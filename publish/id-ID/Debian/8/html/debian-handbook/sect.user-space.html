			“User space” refers to the runtime environment of normal (as opposed to kernel) processes. This does not necessarily mean these processes are actually started by users because a standard system normally has several “daemon” (or background) processes running before the user even opens a session. Daemon processes are also considered user-space processes.

				First of all, a process can clone itself (this is known as a <span
              class="emphasis"><em>fork</em></span>). The kernel allocates a new (but identical) process memory space, and another process to use it. At this time, the only difference between these two processes is their <span
              class="emphasis"><em>pid</em></span>. The new process is usually called a child process, and the original process whose <span
              class="emphasis"><em>pid</em></span> doesn't change, is called the parent process.
			</div><div
            class="para">
				Sometimes, the child process continues to lead its own life independently from its parent, with its own data copied from the parent process. In many cases, though, this child process executes another program. With a few exceptions, its memory is simply replaced by that of the new program, and execution of this new program begins. This is the mechanism used by the init process (with process number 1) to start additional services and execute the whole startup sequence. At some point, one process among <code
              class="command">init</code>'s offspring starts a graphical interface for users to log in to (the actual sequence of events is described in more details in <a

				When a process finishes the task for which it was started, it terminates. The kernel then recovers the memory assigned to this process, and stops giving it slices of running time. The parent process is told about its child process being terminated, which allows a process to wait for the completion of a task it delegated to a child process. This behavior is plainly visible in command-line interpreters (known as <span
              class="emphasis"><em>shells</em></span>). When a command is typed into a shell, the prompt only comes back when the execution of the command is over. Most shells allow for running the command in the background, it is a simple matter of adding an <strong
              class="userinput"><code>&amp;</code></strong> to the end of the command. The prompt is displayed again right away, which can lead to problems if the command needs to display data of its own.

				A “daemon” is a process started automatically by the boot sequence. It keeps running (in the background) to perform maintenance tasks or provide services to other processes. This “background task” is actually arbitrary, and does not match anything particular from the system's point of view. They are simply processes, quite similar to other processes, which run in turn when their time slice comes. The distinction is only in the human language: a process that runs with no interaction with a user (in particular, without any graphical interface) is said to be running “in the background” or “as a daemon”.

				In the case where you do not wish to store data on disk, you can use a <span

If the ends are controlled by separate processes, this leads to a simple and convenient inter-process communication channel. Pipes can be classified into two categories: named pipes, and anonymous pipes. A named pipe is represented by an entry on the filesystem (although the transmitted data is not stored there), so both processes can open it independently if the location of the named pipe is known beforehand. In cases where the communicating processes are related (for instance, a parent and its child process), the parent process can also create an anonymous pipe before forking, and the child inherits it. Both processes will then be able to exchange data through the pipe without needing the filesystem.

				Let's describe in some detail what happens when a complex command (a <span

			</div><div

				The shell first interprets the command typed in. In our case, it understands there are two programs (<code

                class="emphasis"><em>pipe</em></span>). <code

                class="command">bash</code> process itself).
			</div><div

				Then the shell clones itself; this leads to a new <code

                class="emphasis"><em>pids</em></span> are abstract numbers, and generally have no particular meaning). Process #4521 inherits the pipe, which means it is able to write in its “input” side; <code
                class="command">bash</code> redirects its standard output stream to this pipe's input. Then it executes (and replaces itself with) the <code
                class="command">ls</code> program, which lists the contents of the current directory. Since <code
                class="command">ls</code> writes on its standard output, and this output has previously been redirected, the results are effectively sent into the pipe.
			</div><div
              class="para">
				A similar operation happens for the second command: <code
                class="command">bash</code> clones itself again, leading to a new <code

                class="command">sort</code> command, which sorts its input and displays the results.
			</div><div
              class="para">
				All the pieces of the puzzle are now set up: <code
                class="command">ls</code> reads the current directory and writes the list of files into the pipe; <code
                class="command">sort</code> reads this list, sorts it alphabetically, and displays the results. Processes numbers #4521 and #4522 then terminate, and #4374 (which was waiting for them during the operation), resumes control and displays the prompt to allow the user to type in a new command.

				Not all inter-process communications are used to move data around, though. In many situations, the only information that needs to be transmitted are control messages such as “pause execution” or “resume execution”. Unix (and Linux) provides a mechanism known as <span
              class="emphasis"><em>signals</em></span>, through which a process can simply send a specific signal (chosen from a predefined list of signals) to another process. The only requirement is to know the <span

				One of the fundamental concepts that underlies the Unix family of operating systems is that each tool should only do one thing, and do it well; applications can then reuse these tools to build more advanced logic on top. This philosophy can be seen in many incarnations. Shell scripts may be the best example: they assemble complex sequences of very simple tools (such as <code
                class="command">grep</code>, <code
                class="command">wc</code>, <code
                class="command">sort</code>, <code
                class="command">uniq</code> and so on). Another implementation of this philosophy can be seen in code libraries: the <span
                class="emphasis"><em>libpng</em></span> library allows reading and writing PNG images, with different options and in different ways, but it does only that; no question of including functions that display or edit images.
			</div></div><div
            class="para">
				Moreover, these libraries are often referred to as “shared libraries”, since the kernel is able to only load them into memory once, even if several processes use the same library at the same time. This allows saving memory, when compared with the opposite (hypothetical) situation where the code for a library would be loaded as many times as there are processes using it.
