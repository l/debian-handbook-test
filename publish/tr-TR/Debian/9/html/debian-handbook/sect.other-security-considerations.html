			Security is not just a technical problem; more than anything, it is about good practices and understanding the risks.

				The universal character of web applications led to their proliferation. Several are often run in parallel: a webmail, a wiki, some groupware system, forums, a photo gallery, a blog, and so on. Many of those applications rely on the “LAMP” (<span
              class="emphasis"><em>Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP</em></span>) stack. Unfortunately, many of those applications were also written without much consideration for security problems. Data coming from outside is, too often, used with little or no validation. Providing specially-crafted values can be used to subvert a call to a command so that another one is executed instead. Many of the most obvious problems have been fixed as time has passed, but new security problems pop up regularly.

				Apache 2 includes modules allowing filtering incoming HTTP queries. This allows blocking some attack vectors. For instance, limiting the length of parameters can prevent buffer overflows. More generally, one can validate parameters before they are even passed to the web application and restrict access along many criteria. This can even be combined with dynamic firewall updates, so that a client infringing one of the rules is banned from accessing the web server for a given period of time.
			</div><div

				The consequences of an intrusion will have various levels of obviousness depending on the motivations of the attacker. <span
              class="emphasis"><em>Script-kiddies</em></span> only apply recipes they find on web sites; most often, they deface a web page or delete data. In more subtle cases, they add invisible contents to web pages so as to improve referrals to their own sites in search engines.
			</div><div
            class="para">
				A more advanced attacker will go beyond that. A disaster scenario could go on in the following fashion: the attacker gains the ability to execute commands as the <code
              class="literal">www-data</code> user, but executing a command requires many manipulations. To make their life easier, they install other web applications specially designed to remotely execute many kinds of commands, such as browsing the filesystem, examining permissions, uploading or downloading files, executing commands, and even provide a network shell. Often, the vulnerability will allow running a <code
              class="command">wget</code> command that will download some malware into <code
              class="filename">/tmp/</code>, then executing it. The malware is often downloaded from a foreign website that was previously compromised, in order to cover tracks and make it harder to find out the actual origin of the attack.
			</div><div
            class="para">
				At this point, the attacker has enough freedom of movement that they often install an IRC <span
              class="emphasis"><em>bot</em></span> (a robot that connects to an IRC server and can be controlled by this channel). This bot is often used to share illegal files (unauthorized copies of movies or software, and so on). A determined attacker may want to go even further. The <code
              class="literal">www-data</code> account does not allow full access to the machine, and the attacker will try to obtain administrator privileges. Now, this should not be possible, but if the web application was not up-to-date, chances are that the kernel and other programs are outdated too; this sometimes follows a decision from the administrator who, despite knowing about the vulnerability, neglected to upgrade the system since there are no local users. The attacker can then take advantage of this second vulnerability to get root access.

				This term covers anything that can be used to obtain more permissions than a given user should normally have. The <code

			</div></div><div
            class="para">
				Now the attacker owns the machine; they will usually try to keep this privileged access for as long as possible. This involves installing a <span
              class="emphasis"><em>rootkit</em></span>, a program that will replace some components of the system so that the attacker will be able to obtain the administrator privileges again at a later time; the rootkit also tries hiding its own existence as well as any traces of the intrusion. A subverted <code
              class="command">ps</code> program will omit to list some processes, <code
              class="command">netstat</code> will not list some of the active connections, and so on. Using the root permissions, the attacker was able to observe the whole system, but didn't find important data; so they will try accessing other machines in the corporate network. Analyzing the administrator's account and the history files, the attacker finds what machines are routinely accessed. By replacing <code
              class="command">sudo</code> or <code
              class="command">ssh</code> with a subverted program, the attacker can intercept some of the administrator's passwords, which they will use on the detected servers… and the intrusion can propagate from then on.

				Once the potential security problems are known, they must be taken into account at each step of the process of deploying a service, especially when choosing the software to install. Many web sites, such as <code
              class="literal">SecurityFocus.com</code>, keep a list of recently-discovered vulnerabilities, which can give an idea of a security track record before some particular software is deployed. Of course, this information must be balanced against the popularity of said software: a more widely-used program is a more tempting target, and it will be more closely scrutinized as a consequence. On the other hand, a niche program may be full of security holes that never get publicized due to a lack of interest in a security audit.

				In the Free Software world, there is generally ample room for choice, and choosing one piece of software over another should be a decision based on the criteria that apply locally. More features imply an increased risk of a vulnerability hiding in the code; picking the most advanced program for a task may actually be counter-productive, and a better approach is usually to pick the simplest program that meets the requirements.

				Most Linux distributions install by default a number of Unix services and many tools. In many cases, these services and tools are not required for the actual purposes for which the administrator set up the machine. As a general guideline in security matters, unneeded software is best uninstalled. Indeed, there is no point in securing an FTP server, if a vulnerability in a different, unused service can be used to get administrator privileges on the whole machine.
			</div><div

				By the same reasoning, firewalls will often be configured to only allow access to services that are meant to be publicly accessible.

				Current computers are powerful enough to allow hosting several services on the same physical machine. From an economic viewpoint, such a possibility is interesting: only one computer to administrate, lower energy consumption, and so on. From the security point of view, however, such a choice can be a problem. One compromised service can bring access to the whole machine, which in turn compromises the other services hosted on the same computer. This risk can be mitigated by isolating the services. This can be attained either with virtualization (each service being hosted in a dedicated virtual machine or container), or with AppArmor/SELinux (each service daemon having an adequately designed set of permissions).

				An attacker taking control of your machine then using it as a forward base (known as a “relay system”) from which to perform other nefarious activities could cause legal trouble for you, since the attacked party would initially see the attack coming from your system, and therefore consider you as the attacker (or as an accomplice). In many cases, the attacker will use your server as a relay to send spam, which shouldn't have much impact (except potentially registration on black lists that could restrict your ability to send legitimate emails), but won't be pleasant nevertheless. In other cases, more important trouble can be caused from your machine, for instance denial of service attacks. This will sometimes induce loss of revenue, since the legitimate services will be unavailable and data can be destroyed; sometimes this will also imply a real cost, because the attacked party can start legal proceedings against you. Rights-holders can sue you if an unauthorized copy of a work protected by copyright law is shared from your server, as well as other companies compelled by service level agreements if they are bound to pay penalties following the attack from your machine.
