			First, the BIOS takes control of the computer, detects the disks, loads the <span
              class="emphasis"><em>Master Boot Record</em></span>, and executes the bootloader. The bootloader takes over, finds the kernel on the disk, loads and executes it. The kernel is then initialized, and starts to search for and mount the partition containing the root filesystem, and finally executes the first program — <code
              class="command">init</code>. Frequently, this “root partition” and this <code
              class="command">init</code> are, in fact, located in a virtual filesystem that only exists in RAM (hence its name, “initramfs”, formerly called “initrd” for “initialization RAM disk”). This filesystem is loaded in memory by the bootloader, often from a file on a hard drive or from the network. It contains the bare minimum required by the kernel to load the “true” root filesystem: this may be driver modules for the hard drive, or other devices without which the system cannot boot, or, more frequently, initialization scripts and modules for assembling RAID arrays, opening encrypted partitions, activating LVM volumes, etc. Once the root partition is mounted, the initramfs hands over control to the real init, and the machine goes back to the standard boot process.

				To prevent this, you can protect the bootloader itself with a password. You might also think about protecting access to the BIOS (a password protection mechanism is almost always available), without which a malicious intruder could still boot the machine on a removable media containing its own Linux system, which they could then use to access data on the computer's hard drives.

				Finally, be aware that most BIOS have a generic password available. Initially intended for troubleshooting for those who have forgotten their password, these passwords are now public and available on the Internet (see for yourself by searching for “generic BIOS passwords” in a search engine). All of these protections will thus impede unauthorized access to the machine without being able to completely prevent it. There is no reliable way to protect a computer if the attacker can physically access it; they could dismount the hard drives to connect them to a computer under their own control anyway, or even steal the entire machine, or erase the BIOS memory to reset the password…

				A systemd “service file” describes a process managed by systemd. It contains roughly the same information as old-style init-scripts, but expressed in a declaratory (and much more concise) way. Systemd handles the bulk of the repetitive tasks (starting and stopping the process, checking its status, logging, dropping privileges, and so on), and the service file only needs to fill in the specifics of the process. For instance, here is the service file for SSH:
			</div><pre

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
Alias=sshd.service
</pre><div
              class="para">
				As you can see, there is very little code in there, only declarations. Systemd takes care of displaying progress reports, keeping track of the processes, and even restarting them when needed.
			</div><div
              class="para">
				A systemd “target file” describes a state of the system, where a set of services are known to be operational. It can be thought of as an equivalent of the old-style runlevel. One of the targets is <code
                class="literal">local-fs.target</code>; when it is reached, the rest of the system can assume that all local filesystems are mounted and accessible. Other targets include <code
                class="literal">network-online.target</code> and <code
                class="literal">sound.target</code>. The dependencies of a target can be listed either within the target file (in the <code
                class="literal">Requires=</code> line), or using a symbolic link to a service file in the <code
                class="literal">/lib/systemd/system/<em
                  class="replaceable">targetname</em>.target.wants/</code> directory. For instance, <code
                class="filename">/etc/systemd/system/printer.target.wants/</code> contains a link to <code
                class="filename">/lib/systemd/system/cups.service</code>; systemd will therefore ensure CUPS is running in order to reach <code
                class="literal">printer.target</code>.

              class="para">
				Since unit files are declarative rather than scripts or programs, they cannot be run directly, and they are only interpreted by systemd; several utilities therefore allow the administrator to interact with systemd and control the state of the system and of each component.
			</div><div
              class="para">
				The first such utility is <code
                class="command">systemctl</code>. When run without any arguments, it lists all the unit files known to systemd (except those that have been disabled), as well as their status. <code
                class="command">systemctl status</code> gives a better view of the services, as well as the related processes. If given the name of a service (as in <code
                class="command">systemctl status ntp.service</code>), it returns even more details, as well as the last few log lines related to the service (more on that later).
			</div><div
              class="para">
				Starting a service by hand is a simple matter of running <code
                class="command">systemctl start <em
                  class="replaceable">servicename</em>.service</code>. As one can guess, stopping the service is done with <code
                class="command">systemctl stop <em
                  class="replaceable">servicename</em>.service</code>; other subcommands include <code
                class="command">reload</code> and <code
                class="command">restart</code>.
			</div><div
              class="para">
				To control whether a service is active (i.e. whether it will get started automatically on boot), use <code
                class="command">systemctl enable <em
                  class="replaceable">servicename</em>.service</code> (or <code
                class="command">disable</code>). <code
                class="command">is-enabled</code> allows checking the status of the service.

				An interesting feature of systemd is that it includes a logging component named <code
                class="command">journald</code>. It comes as a complement to more traditional logging systems such as <code
                class="command">syslogd</code>, but it adds interesting features such as a formal link between a service and the messages it generates, and the ability to capture error messages generated by its initialisation sequence. The messages can be displayed later on, with a little help from the <code
                class="command">journalctl</code> command. Without any arguments, it simply spews all log messages that occurred since system boot; it will rarely be used in such a manner. Most of the time, it will be used with a service identifier:

				After this stage, <code

The static numbering of scripts is therefore no longer taken into consideration (but they must always have a name beginning with “S” followed by two digits and the actual name of the script used for the dependencies). Generally, base services (such as logging with <code
                class="command">rsyslog</code>, or port assignment with <code
                class="command">portmap</code>) are started first, followed by standard services and the graphical interface (<code

				This dependency-based boot system makes it possible to automate re-numbering, which could be rather tedious if it had to be done manually, and it limits the risks of human error, since scheduling is conducted according to the parameters that are indicated. Another benefit is that services can be started in parallel when they are independent from one another, which can accelerate the boot process.

				The maintainer scripts for Debian packages will sometimes restart certain services to ensure their availability or get them to take certain options into account. The command that controls a service — <code
                  class="command">service <em
                    class="replaceable">service</em> <em
                    class="replaceable">operation</em></code> — doesn't take runlevel into consideration, assumes (wrongly) that the service is currently being used, and may thus initiate incorrect operations (starting a service that was deliberately stopped, or stopping a service that is already stopped, etc.). Debian therefore introduced the <code
                  class="command">invoke-rc.d</code> program: this program must be used by maintainer scripts to run services initialization scripts and it will only execute the necessary commands. Note that, contrary to common usage, the <code
                  class="filename">.d</code> suffix is used here in a program name, and not in a directory.

				The first computers were usually separated into several, very large parts: the storage enclosure and the central processing unit were separate from the peripheral devices used by the operators to control them.
