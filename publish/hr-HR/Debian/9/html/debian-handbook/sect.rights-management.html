			Linux is definitely a multi-user system, so it is necessary to provide a permission system to control the set of authorized operations on files and directories, which includes all the system resources and devices (on a Unix system, any device is represented by a file or directory). This principle is common to all Unix systems, but a reminder is always useful, especially as there are some interesting and relatively unknown advanced uses.

			In the case of a file, these rights are easily understood: read access allows reading the content (including copying), write access allows changing it, and execute access allows you to run it (which will only work if it is a program).

This mechanism grants access to features requiring higher level permissions than those you would usually have.

			A directory is handled differently. Read access gives the right to consult the list of its entries (files and directories), write access allows creating or deleting files, and execute access allows crossing through it (especially to go there with the <code
            class="command">cd</code> command). Being able to cross through a directory without being able to read it gives permission to access the entries therein that are known by name, but not to find them if you do not know their existence or their exact name.

			There are two ways of presenting rights. Among them, the symbolic representation is probably the easiest to understand and remember. It involves the letter symbols mentioned above. You can define rights for each category of users (<code
            class="literal">u</code>/<code
            class="literal">g</code>/<code
            class="literal">o</code>), by setting them explicitly (with <code
            class="literal">=</code>), by adding (<code
            class="literal">+</code>), or subtracting (<code
            class="literal">-</code>). Thus the <code
            class="literal">u=rwx,g+rw,o-r</code> formula gives the owner read, write, and execute rights, adds read and write rights for the owner group, and removes read rights for other users. Rights not altered by the addition or subtraction in such a command remain unmodified. The letter <code
            class="literal">a</code>, for “all”, covers all three categories of users, so that <code
            class="literal">a=rx</code> grants all three categories the same rights (read and execute, but not write).

			The (octal) numeric representation associates each right with a value: 4 for read, 2 for write, and 1 for execute. We associate each combination of rights with the sum of the figures. Each value is then assigned to different categories of users by putting them end to end in the usual order (owner, group, others).
		</div><div
          class="para">
			For instance, the <code
            class="command">chmod 754 <em
              class="replaceable">file</em></code> command will set the following rights: read, write and execute for the owner (since 7 = 4 + 2 + 1); read and execute for the group (since 5 = 4 + 1); read-only for others. The <code
            class="literal">0</code> means no rights; thus <code
            class="command">chmod 600 <em
              class="replaceable">file</em></code> allows for read/write rights for the owner, and no rights for anyone else. The most frequent right combinations are <code
            class="literal">755</code> for executable files and directories, and <code
            class="literal">644</code> for data files.
		</div><div

			To represent special rights, you can prefix a fourth digit to this number according to the same principle, where the <code
            class="literal">setuid</code>, <code
            class="literal">setgid</code> and <code
            class="literal">sticky</code> bits are 4, 2 and 1, respectively. <code

		</div><div
          class="para">
			Note that the use of octal notation only allows to set all the rights at once on a file; you cannot use it to simply add a new right, such as read access for the group owner, since you must take into account the existing rights and compute the new corresponding numerical value.

			The distinction between directories and files sometimes causes problems with recursive operations. That is why the “X” letter has been introduced in the symbolic representation of rights.

              class="command">chmod -R a+X <em
                class="replaceable">directory</em></code> will only add execute rights for all categories of users (<code
