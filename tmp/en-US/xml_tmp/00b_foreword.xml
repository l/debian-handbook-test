  <para>Linux has been garnering strength for a number of years now, and its
  growing popularity drives more and more users to make the jump. The first
  step on that path is to pick a distribution. This is an important
  decision, because each distribution has its own peculiarities, and future
  migration costs can be avoided if the right choice is made from the
  start.</para>

    <para>Strictly speaking, Linux is only a kernel, the core piece of
    software which sits between the hardware and the applications.</para>

    <para>A “Linux distribution” is a full operating system; it usually
    includes the Linux kernel, an installer program, and most importantly
    applications and other software required to turn a computer into a
    tool that is actually useful.</para>
  </sidebar>

  <para>Debian GNU/Linux is a “generic” Linux distribution that fits
  most users. The purpose of this book is to show its many aspects so that you
  can make an informed decision when choosing.</para>

      <title><emphasis>CULTURE</emphasis> Commercial distributions</title>
      <indexterm><primary>distribution</primary><secondary>commercial distribution</secondary></indexterm>

      <para>Most Linux distributions are backed by a for-profit company
      that develops them and sells them under some kind of commercial
      scheme. Examples include <emphasis>Ubuntu</emphasis>, mainly
      developed by <emphasis>Canonical Ltd.</emphasis>; <emphasis>Red Hat
      Enterprise Linux</emphasis>, by <emphasis>Red Hat</emphasis>;
      and <emphasis>SUSE Linux</emphasis>, maintained and made commercially
      available by <emphasis>Novell</emphasis>.</para>

      <para>At the other end of the spectrum lie the likes of Debian and
      the Apache Software Foundation (which hosts the development for the
      Apache web server). Debian is above all a project in the Free
      Software world, implemented by volunteers working together through
      the Internet.  While some of them do work on Debian as part of
      their paid job in various companies, the project as a whole is
      not attached to any company in particular, nor does any one
      company have a greater say in the project's affairs than
      what purely volunteer contributors have.</para>
    </sidebar>

    <para>Linux has gathered a fair amount of media coverage over the
    years; it mostly
    benefits the distributions supported by a real marketing department —
    in other words, company-backed distributions (Ubuntu, Red Hat,
    SUSE, and so on). But Debian is far from being a marginal
    distribution; multiple studies have shown over the years that it is
    widely used both on servers and on desktops. This
    is particularly true among webservers where Debian and Ubuntu are the leading
    Linux distributions.
    <ulink type="block" url="https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/os-debian/all/all"/></para>

    <para>The purpose of this book is to help you discover this
    distribution. We hope to share the experience that we have gathered since we
    joined the project as developers and contributors in 1998 (Raphaël)
    and 2000 (Roland). With any luck, our enthusiasm will be communicative,
    and maybe you will join us sometime…</para>

    <para>The first edition of this book (in 2004) served to fill a
    gaping hole: it was the first French-language book that focused
    exclusively on Debian. At that time, many other books were written
    on the topic both for French-speaking and English-speaking
    readers. Unfortunately almost none of them got updated, and over
    the years the situation slipped back to one where there were very
    few good books on Debian. We hope that this book, which has
    started a new life with its translation into English (and several
    translations from English into various other languages), will
    fill this gap and help many users.</para>
  </section>
  <section id="sect.who-is-this-book-for">
    <title>Who Is this Book For?</title>

    <para>We tried to make this book useful for many categories of readers.
    First, systems administrators (both beginners and experienced) will
    find explanations about the installation and deployment of Debian on
    many computers. They will also get a glimpse of most of the services
    available on Debian, along with matching configuration instructions and
    a description of the specifics coming from the distribution.
    Understanding the mechanisms involved in Debian's development will
    enable them to deal with unforeseen problems, knowing that they can
    always find help within the community.</para>

    <para>Users of another Linux distribution, or of another Unix variant,
    will discover the specifics of Debian, and should become operational
    very quickly while benefiting fully from the unique advantages of this
    distribution.</para>

    <para>Finally, readers who already have some knowledge of Debian and
    want to know more about the community behind it should see their
    expectations fulfilled. This book should make them much closer to
    joining us as contributors.</para>
  </section>
  <section id="sect.selected-approach">
    <title>General Approach</title>

    <para>All of the generic documentation you can find about GNU/Linux
    also applies to Debian, since Debian includes most common free
    software. However, the distribution brings many enhancements, which is
    why we chose to primarily describe the “Debian way” of doing
    things.</para>

    <para>It is interesting to follow the Debian recommendations, but it is
    even better to understand their rationale. Therefore, we won't restrict
    ourselves to practical explanations only; we will also describe the
    project's workings, so as to provide you with comprehensive and
    consistent knowledge.</para>

    <title>Book Structure</title>

    <para>This book is built around a case study providing both support and
    illustration for all topics being addressed.</para>

    <sidebar>
      <title><emphasis>NOTE</emphasis> Web site, authors' email</title>

      <para>This book has its own website, which hosts whatever elements
      that can make it more useful. In particular, it includes an online
      version of the book with clickable links, and possible errata. Feel
      free to browse it and to leave us some feedback. We will be happy to
      read your comments or support messages. Send them by email to
      <email>hertzog@debian.org</email> (Raphaël) and
      <email>lolando@debian.org</email> (Roland).
      <ulink type="block" url="http://debian-handbook.info/"/></para>
    </sidebar>

    <para><emphasis role="strong">Chapter 1</emphasis> focuses on a
    non-technical presentation of the Debian project and describes its
    goals and organization. These aspects are important because they define
    a general framework that other chapters will complete with more
    concrete information.</para>

    <para><emphasis role="strong">Chapters 2 and 3</emphasis> provide a
    broad outline of the case study. At this point, novice readers can take
    the time to read <emphasis role="strong">appendix B</emphasis>, where
    they will find a short remedial course explaining a number of basic
    computing notions, as well as concepts inherent to any Unix
    system.</para>

    <para>To get on with our real subject matter, we will quite naturally
    start with the installation process (<emphasis role="strong">chapter
    4</emphasis>); <emphasis role="strong">chapters 5 and 6</emphasis> will
    unveil basic tools that any Debian administrator will use, such as
    those of the <emphasis role="strong">APT</emphasis> family, which is
    largely responsible for the distribution's excellent reputation. These
    chapters are in no way restricted to professionals, since everyone is
    their own administrator at home.</para>

    <para><emphasis role="strong">Chapter 7</emphasis> will be an important
    parenthesis; it describes workflows to efficiently use documentation
    and to quickly gain an understanding of problems in order to solve
    them.</para>

    <para>The next chapters will be a more detailed tour of the system,
    starting with basic infrastructure and services (<emphasis
    role="strong">chapters 8 to 10</emphasis>) and going progressively up
    the stack to reach the user applications in <emphasis role="strong">chapter
    13</emphasis>. <emphasis role="strong">Chapter 12</emphasis> deals with
    more advanced subjects that will most directly concern administrators
    of large sets of computers (including servers), while <emphasis
    role="strong">chapter 14</emphasis> is a brief introduction to the
    wider subject of computer security and gives a few keys to avoid most
    problems.</para>

    <para><emphasis role="strong">Chapter 15</emphasis> is for
    administrators who want to go further and create their own Debian
    packages.</para>

      <para>A Debian package is an archive containing all the files
      required to install a piece of software. It is generally a file with
      a <filename>.deb</filename> extension, and it can be handled with the
      <command>dpkg</command> command. Also called a <emphasis>binary
      package</emphasis>, it contains files that can be directly used (such
      as programs or documentation). On the other hand, a <emphasis>source
      package</emphasis> contains the source code for the software and the
      instructions required for building the binary package.</para>
    </sidebar>

    <para>The present version is already the eighth edition of the book
    (we include the first four that were only available in French).
    This edition covers version 9 of Debian, code-named <emphasis
    role="distribution">Stretch</emphasis>. Among the changes, Debian
    now sports a new architecture — <emphasis>mips64el</emphasis> for
    little-endian 64-bit MIPS processors. On the opposite side,
    the <emphasis>powerpc</emphasis> architecture has been dropped due
    to lack of volunteers to keep up with development (which itself can be
    explained by the fact that associated hardware is getting old and less
    interesting to work on). All included packages have
    obviously been updated, including the GNOME desktop, which is now in
    its version 3.22. Most executables have been rebuilt with
    PIE build flags thus enabling supplementary hardening measures
    (Address Space Layout Randomization, ASLR).</para>

    <para>We have added some notes and remarks in sidebars. They have a
    variety of roles: they can draw attention to a difficult point,
    complete a notion of the case study, define some terms, or serve as
    reminders. Here is a list of the most common of these sidebars:</para>

	<para>POLICY: a rule or recommendation from the Debian Policy. This
	document is essential within the project, and describes how to
	package software. The parts of the policy highlighted in this book
	bring direct benefits to users (for example, knowing that the

	makes it easy to find them even in a new package).</para>

      <title>A Bit of History</title>

      <para>In 2003, Nat Makarévitch contacted Raphaël because he
      wanted to publish a book on Debian in the <foreignphrase>Cahier
      de l'Admin</foreignphrase> (Admin's Handbook) collection that he
      was managing for Eyrolles, a leading French editor of technical
      books.  Raphaël immediately accepted to write it. The first
      edition came out on 14th October 2004 and was a huge success —
      it was sold out barely four months later.</para>

      <para>Since then, we have released 7 other editions of the
      French book, one for each subsequent Debian release.  Roland,
      who started working on the book as a proofreader, gradually
      became its co-author.</para>

      <para>While we were obviously satisfied with the book's success, we
      always hoped that Eyrolles would convince an international editor to
      translate it into English. We had received numerous comments
      explaining how the book helped people to get started with Debian, and
      we were keen to have the book benefit more people in the same
      way.</para>

      <para>Alas, no English-speaking editor that we contacted was willing
      to take the risk of translating and publishing the book. Not put off
      by this small setback, we negotiated with our French editor
      Eyrolles and got back the necessary rights to translate the book
      into English and publish it ourselves. Thanks to a <ulink
        url="http://www.ulule.com/debian-handbook/">successful
        crowdfunding campaign</ulink>, we worked on the translation between December
      2011 and May 2012. The “Debian Administrator's Handbook” was born
      and it was published under a free-software license!
      </para>

      <para>While this was an important milestone, we already knew that
      the story would not be over for us until we could contribute the
      French book as an official translation of the English book. This
      was not possible at that time because the French book was still
      distributed commercially under a non-free license by Eyrolles.</para>

      <para>In 2013, the release of Debian 7 gave us a good opportunity to
      discuss a new contract with Eyrolles. We convinced them that a
      license more in line with the Debian values would contribute to the
      book's success. That wasn't an easy deal to make, and we agreed
      to setup another <ulink
        url="http://www.ulule.com/liberation-cahier-admin-debian/">crowdfunding
        campaign</ulink> to cover some of the costs and reduce the risks
      involved. The operation was again a huge success and in July 2013,
      we added a French translation to the Debian Administrator's
      Handbook.</para>
      <para>
        We would like to thank everybody who contributed to these
        fundraising campaigns, either by pledging some money or by passing
        the word around. We couldn't have done it without you.
      </para>
      <para>
        To save some paper, 5 years after the fundraising campaigns and after
        two subsequent editions, we dropped the list of persons who opted
        to be rewarded with a mention of their name in the book. But
        their names are engraved in the acknowledgments of the Wheezy edition
        of the book:

      <title>Special Thanks to Contributors</title>

      <para>This book would not be what it is without the contributions of
      several persons who each played an important role during the
      translation phase and beyond. We would like to
      thank Marilyne Brun, who helped us to translate the sample chapter
      and who worked with us to define some common translation rules. She
      also revised several chapters which were desperately in need of
      supplementary work. Thank you to Anthony Baldwin (of Baldwin Linguas)
      who translated several chapters for us.</para>

      <para>We benefited from the generous help of proofreaders: Daniel
      Phillips, Gerold Rupprecht, Gordon Dey, Jacob Owens, and Tom Syroid.
      They each reviewed many chapters. Thank you very much!</para>

      <para>Then, once the English version was liberated, of course we
      got plenty of feedback and suggestions and fixes from the
      readers, and even more from the many teams who undertook to
      translate this book into other languages.  Thanks!</para>

      <para>We would also like to thank the readers of the French book
      who provided us some nice quotes to confirm that the book was
      really worth being translated: thank you Christian Perrier,
      David Bercot, Étienne Liétart, and Gilles Roussi. Stefano Zacchiroli
      — who was Debian Project Leader during the crowdfunding campaign —
      also deserves a big thank you, he kindly endorsed the project
      with a quote explaining that free (as in freedom) books were more
      than needed.</para>

      <para>If you have the pleasure to read these lines in a paperback
      copy of the book, then you should join us to thank Benoît Guillon,
      Jean-Côme Charpentier, and Sébastien Mengin who worked on the
      interior book design. Benoît is the upstream author of <ulink
      url="http://dblatex.sourceforge.net">dblatex</ulink> — the tool we
      used to convert DocBook into LaTeX (and then PDF). Sébastien is the
      designer who created this nice book layout and Jean-Côme is the
      LaTeX expert who implemented it as a stylesheet usable with dblatex.
      Thank you guys for all the hard work!</para>

      <para>Finally, thank you to Thierry Stempfel for the nice pictures
      introducing each chapter, and thank you to Doru Patrascu for the
      beautiful book cover.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Thanks to Translators</title>
      <para>Ever since the book has been freed, many volunteers have been
      busy translating it to numerous languages, such as Arabic, Brazilian
      Portuguese, German, Italian, Spanish, Japanese, Norwegian
      Bokmål, etc. Discover the full list of translations on the book's

      into the hands of millions of persons who cannot read English.</para>

      <title>Personal Acknowledgments from Raphaël</title>

      <para>First off, I would like to thank Nat Makarévitch, who offered
      me the possibility to write this book and who provided strong
      guidance during the year it took to get it done. Thank you also to
      the fine team at Eyrolles, and Muriel Shan Sei Fan in particular. She
      has been very patient with me and I learned a lot with her.</para>

      <para>The period of the Ulule campaigns were very demanding for me but
      I would like to thank everybody who helped to make them a success, and
      in particular the Ulule team who reacted very quickly to my many
      requests. Thank you also to everybody who promoted the operations. I
      don't have any exhaustive list (and if I had it would probably be too
      long) but I would like to thank a few people who were in touch with
      me: Joey-Elijah Sneddon and Benjamin Humphrey of OMG! Ubuntu,
      Florent Zara of LinuxFr.org, Manu of Korben.info,
      Frédéric Couchet of April.org, Jake Edge of Linux Weekly News,
      Clement Lefebvre of Linux Mint, Ladislav Bodnar of Distrowatch, Steve
      Kemp of Debian-Administration.org, Christian Pfeiffer Jensen of
      Debian-News.net, Artem Nosulchik of LinuxScrew.com, Stephan Ramoin of
      Gandi.net, Matthew Bloch of Bytemark.co.uk, the team at Divergence
      FM, Rikki Kite of Linux New Media, Jono Bacon, the marketing team at
      Eyrolles, and numerous others that I have forgotten (sorry about
      that).</para>

      <para>I would like to address a special thanks to Roland Mas, my
      co-author. We have been collaborating on this book since the start
      and he has always been up to the challenge. And I must say that
      completing the Debian Administrator's Handbook has been a lot of
      work…</para>

      <para>Last but not least, thank you to my wife, Sophie. She has been
      very supportive of my work on this book and on Debian in general.
      There have been too many days (and nights) when I left her alone with
      our 2 sons to make some progress on the book. I am grateful
      for her support and know how lucky I am to have her.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Personal Acknowledgments from Roland</title>

      <para>Well, Raphaël preempted most of my “external” thank-yous
      already. I am still going to emphasize my personal gratitude to the
      good folks at Eyrolles, with whom collaboration has always been
      pleasant and smooth. Hopefully the results of their excellent advice
      hasn't been lost in translation.</para>

      <para>I am extremely grateful to Raphaël for taking on the
      administrative part of this English edition. From organizing the
      funding campaign to the last details of the book layout, producing a
      translated book is so much more than just translating and
      proofreading, and Raphaël did (or delegated and supervised) it all.
      So thanks.</para>

      <para>Thanks also to all who more or less directly contributed to
      this book, by providing clarifications or explanations, or
      translating advice. They are too many to mention, but most of them
      can usually be found on various #debian-* IRC channels.</para>

      <para>There is of course some overlap with the previous set of
      people, but specific thanks are still in order for the people who
      actually do Debian. There wouldn't be much of a book without them,
      and I am still amazed at what the Debian project as a whole produces
      and makes available to any and all.</para>

      <para>More personal thanks go to my friends and my clients, for their
      understanding when I was less responsive because I was working on
      this book, and also for their constant support, encouragement and
      egging on. You know who you are; thanks.</para>

      <para>And finally; I am sure they would be surprised by being
      mentioned here, but I would like to extend my gratitude to Terry
      Pratchett, Jasper Fforde, Tom Holt, William Gibson, Neal
      Stephenson, and of course the late Douglas Adams. The countless
      hours I spent enjoying their books are directly responsible for
      my being able to take part in translating one first and writing
      new parts later.</para>
