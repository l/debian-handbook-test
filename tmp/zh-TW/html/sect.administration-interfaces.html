			Using a graphical interface for administration is interesting in various circumstances. An administrator does not necessarily know all the configuration details for all their services, and doesn't always have the time to go seeking out the documentation on the matter. A graphical interface for administration can thus accelerate the deployment of a new service. It can also simplify the setup of services which are hard to configure.
		</div><div
          class="para">
			Such an interface is only an aid, and not an end in itself. In all cases, the administrator must master its behavior in order to understand and work around any potential problem.
		</div><div
          class="para">
			Since no interface is perfect, you may be tempted to try several solutions. This is to be avoided as much as possible, since different tools are sometimes incompatible in their work methods. Even if they all aim to be very flexible and try to adopt the configuration file as a single reference, they are not always able to integrate external changes.

				The Debian Policy expressly stipulates that everything should be done to preserve manual changes made to a configuration file, so more and more scripts take precautions when editing configuration files. The general principle is simple: the script will only make changes if it knows the status of the configuration file, which is verified by comparing the checksum of the file against that of the last automatically generated file. If they are the same, the script is authorized to change the configuration file. Otherwise, it determines that the file has been changed and asks what action it should take (install the new file, save the old file, or try to integrate the new changes with the existing file). This precautionary principle has long been unique to Debian, but other distributions have gradually begun to embrace it.
