  <highlights>
    <para>In the context of this book, you are the system
    administrator of a growing small business. The time has come for
    you to redefine the information systems master plan for the coming
    year in collaboration with your directors.  You choose to
    progressively migrate to Debian, both for practical and economical
    reasons. Let's see in more detail what's in store for you…</para>
  </highlights>

  <para>We have envisioned this case study to approach all modern
  information system services currently used in a medium sized company.
  After reading this book, you will have all of the elements necessary to
  install Debian on your servers and fly on your own wings. You will also
  learn how to efficiently find information in the event of
  difficulties.</para>

    <para>Falcot Corp is a manufacturer of high quality audio
    equipment.  The company is growing strongly, and has two
    facilities, one in Saint-Étienne, and another in Montpellier. The
    former has around 150 employees; it hosts a factory for the
    manufacturing of speakers, a design lab, and all administrative
    office. The Montpellier site is smaller, with only about 50
    workers, and produces amplifiers.</para>

      purely coincidental. Likewise, some example data throughout
      this book may be fictional.</para>

    <para>The information system has had difficulty keeping up with the
    company's growth, so they are now determined to completely redefine it
    to meet various goals established by management:</para>

    <para>The switch to Debian will be gradual; a small business, with
    limited means, cannot reasonably change everything overnight. For
    starters, the IT staff must be trained in Debian
    administration. The servers will then be converted, starting with
    the network infrastructure (routers, firewalls, etc.) followed by
    the user services (file sharing, Web, SMTP, etc.). Then the office
    computers will be gradually migrated to Debian, for each
    department to be trained (internally) during the deployment of the
    new system.</para>

  <section id="sect.why-gnu-linux">
    <title>De ce o distribuție de GNU/Linux?</title>

    <sidebar>
      <title><emphasis>ÎNAPOI LA NOȚIUNILE DE BAZĂ</emphasis> Linux sau GNU/Linux?</title>
      <indexterm><primary>GNU/Linux</primary></indexterm>
      <indexterm><primary>Linux</primary></indexterm>

      <para>Linux, as you already know, is only a kernel. The expressions,
      “Linux distribution” and “Linux system” are, thus, incorrect:
      they are, in reality, distributions or systems <emphasis>based
      on</emphasis> Linux. These expressions fail to mention the software
      that always completes this kernel, among which are the programs
      developed by the GNU Project. Dr. Richard Stallman, founder of this
      project, insists that the expression “GNU/Linux” be
      systematically used, in order to better recognize the important
      contributions made by the GNU Project and the principles of freedom
      upon which they are founded.</para>

      
      <para>Debian has chosen to follow this recommendation, and, thus,
      name its distributions accordingly (thus, the latest stable release
      is Debian GNU/Linux 9).</para>
    </sidebar>

    <para>Several factors have dictated this choice. The system
    administrator, who was familiar with this distribution, ensured it
    was listed among the candidates for the computer system
    overhaul. Difficult economic conditions and ferocious competition
    have limited the budget for this operation, despite its critical
    importance for the future of the company. This is why Open Source
    solutions were swiftly chosen: several recent studies indicate
    they are less expensive than proprietary solutions while providing
    equal or better quality of service so long as qualified personnel
    are available to run them.</para>

    <sidebar>
      <title><emphasis>ÎN PRACTICĂ</emphasis> Costul total de proprietate (CTP)</title>
      <indexterm><primary>CTP</primary></indexterm>
      <indexterm><primary>Costul total de proprietate</primary></indexterm>

      <para>The Total Cost of Ownership is the total of all money expended
      for the possession or acquisition of an item, in this case referring
      to the operating system. This price includes any possible license fee,
      costs for training personnel to work with the new software,
      replacement of machines that are too slow, additional repairs, etc.
      Everything arising directly from the initial choice is taken into
      account.</para>

      <para>This TCO, which varies according to the criteria chosen in
      the assessment thereof, is rarely significant when taken in
      isolation. However, it is very interesting to compare TCOs for
      different options if they are calculated according to the same
      rules. This assessment table is, thus, of paramount importance,
      and it is easy to manipulate it in order to draw a predefined
      conclusion.  Thus, the TCO for a single machine doesn't make
      sense, since the cost of an administrator is also reflected in
      the total number of machines they manage, a number which
      obviously depends on the operating system and tools
      proposed.</para>
    </sidebar>

    <para>Among free operating systems, the IT department looked at
    the free BSD systems (OpenBSD, FreeBSD, and NetBSD), GNU Hurd, and
    Linux distributions. GNU Hurd, which has not yet released a stable
    version, was immediately rejected. The choice is simpler between
    BSD and Linux.  The former have many merits, especially on
    servers. Pragmatism, however, led to choosing a Linux system,
    since its installed base and popularity are both very significant
    and have many positive consequences. One of these consequences is
    that it is easier to find qualified personnel to administer Linux
    machines than technicians experienced with BSD. Furthermore, Linux
    adapts to newer hardware faster than BSD (although they are often
    neck and neck in this race).  Finally, Linux distributions are
    often more adapted to user-friendly graphical user interfaces,
    indispensable for beginners during migration of all office
    machines to a new system.</para>

      <para>Since Debian 6 <emphasis role="distribution">Squeeze</emphasis>, it is possible to use
      Debian with a FreeBSD kernel on 32 and 64 bit computers; this is
      what the <literal>kfreebsd-i386</literal> and
      <literal>kfreebsd-amd64</literal> architectures mean. While
      these architectures are not “official release architectures”,
      about 90 % of the software packaged by Debian is available for
      them.</para>

      <para>Aceste arhitecturi pot reprezenta alegerea potrivită pentru administratorii firmei Falcot S.R.L., în special pentru un „firewall” (nucleul are suport pentru trei paravane diferite: IPF, IPFW, PF) sau pentru un NAS (sistem de stocare conectat la rețea, pentru care sistemul de fișiere ZFS a fost testat și avizat).</para>
    </sidebar>
  </section>
  <section id="sect.why-debian">
    <title>De ce distribuția Debian?</title>

    <para>Once the Linux family has been selected, a more specific
    option must be chosen. Again, there are plenty of criteria to
    consider. The chosen distribution must be able to operate for
    several years, since the migration from one to another would
    entail additional costs (although less than if the migration were
    between two totally different operating systems, such as Windows
    or OS X).</para>

    <para>Sustenabilitatea este, de aceea, esențială și trebuie să garanteze actualizări regulate și petice de securitate pentru mai mulți ani. Sincronizarea actualizărilor este și ea importantă, din moment ce, cu așa de multe mașini de gestionat, firma Falcot S.R.L. nu poate să facă față unei astfel de operațiuni complexe prea frecvent. Așa că, departamentul de TI insistă să ruleze ultima versiune stabilă a distribuției, beneficiând de cea mai bună asistență tehnică și petice de securitate garantate. În consecință, actualizările de securitate sunt în general garantate doar pe o durată limitată pentru versiunile mai vechi ale unei distribuții.</para>

    <para>
      Finally, for reasons of homogeneity and ease of administration,
      the same distribution must run on all the servers and office
      computers.
    </para>

    <section>
      <title>Distribuții comerciale sau conduse de comunitate</title>

      <para>Există două categorii mari de distribuții de GNU/Linux: comerciale și conduse de comunitate. Prima, dezvoltată de firme, este vândută cu servicii de asistență comercială. A doua este dezvoltată conform aceluiași model de dezvoltare transparent folosit de programele libere pe care le include.</para>

      <para>A commercial distribution will have, thus, a tendency to
      release new versions more frequently, in order to better market
      updates and associated services. Their future is directly connected
      to the commercial success of their company, and many have already
      disappeared (Caldera Linux, StormLinux, Mandriva Linux, etc.).</para>

      <para>O distribuție condusă de comunitate urmează doar planificarea proprie. Ca nucleul Linux, versiunile noi sunt lansate când sunt stabile, niciodată mai devreme. Supraviețuirea lor este garantată, atâta timp cât are destui dezvoltatori sau firme terțe să o susțină.</para>

      <para>O comparație între diferitele distribuții de GNU/Linux a condus la alegerea lui Debian din mai multe motive:</para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
	  <para>Este o distribuție comunitară, cu dezvoltarea asigurată independent de constrângerile comerciale; obiectivele sale sunt, astfel, esențial de natură tehnică, care pare să favorizeze calitatea de ansamblu a produsului.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
	  <para>Of all community distributions, it is the most significant
	  from many perspectives: in number of contributors, number of
	  software packages available, and years of continuous existence.
	  The size of its community is an incontestable witness to its
	  continuity.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
	  <para>Statistically, new versions are released every 18 to 24
          months, and they are supported for 5 years, a schedule which
          is agreeable to administrators.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
	  <para>Un studiu al mai multor firme franțuzești care oferă servicii specializate pe programe libere a arătat că toate oferă asistență tehnică pentru Debian; de asemenea, este distribuția aleasă pentru utilizarea internă de multe dintre ele. Această diversitate de potențiali furnizori este o valoare importantă pentru independența firmei Falcot S.R.L.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
	  <para>Finally, Debian is available on a multitude of
          architectures, including ppc64el for OpenPOWER processors; it
          will, thus, be possible to install it on Falcot Corp's latest
          IBM servers.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <sidebar>
        <title><emphasis>IN PRACTICE</emphasis> Debian Long Term Support</title>
        <para>The Debian Long Term Support (LTS) project started in 2014
        and aims to provide 5 years of security support to all stable
        Debian releases. As LTS is of primary importance to
        organizations with large deployments, the project tries to pool
        resources from Debian-using companies.
        <ulink type="block" url="https://wiki.debian.org/LTS" />
        </para>
        <para>Falcot Corp is not big enough to let one member of its IT staff
        contribute to the LTS project, so the company opted to subscribe
        to Freexian's Debian LTS contract and provides financial support.
        Thanks to this, the Falcot administrators know that the packages
        they use will be handled in priority and they have a direct
        contact with the LTS team in case of problems.
        <ulink type="block" url="https://wiki.debian.org/LTS/Funding" />
        <ulink type="block" url="https://www.freexian.com/services/debian-lts.html" />
        </para>
      </sidebar>

      <para>Once Debian has been chosen, the matter of which version to use
      must be decided. Let us see why the administrators have picked Debian
      Stretch.</para>
    </section>
  </section>
  <section id="sect.why-debian-stable">
    <title>Why Debian Stretch?</title>

    <para>Every Debian release starts its life as a continuously
    changing distribution, also known as “<emphasis role="distribution">Testing</emphasis>”. But at the time we write
    those lines, Debian Stretch is the latest “<emphasis role="distribution">Stable</emphasis>” version of Debian.</para>

    <para>The choice of Debian Stretch is well justified based on the fact
    that any administrator concerned about the quality of their servers
    will naturally gravitate towards the stable version of Debian.
    Even if the previous stable release might still be supported for a
    while, Falcot administrators aren't considering it because its
    support period will not last long enough and because the latest
    version brings new interesting features that they care about.</para>
