  <title>Prakata</title>

  <para>Debian adalah sistem operasi yang sangat sukses, yang merambah dalam kehidupan digital kita lebih dari yang sering kita bayangkan atau sadari. Beberapa fakta cukup untuk menjelaskan hal ini. Pada saat penulisan (buku ini), Debian adalah varian GNU/Linux yang paling populer di antara web server: menurut <ulink url="http://w3techs.com/">W3Techs</ulink>, lebih dari 10% dari web menggunakan Debian sebagai servernya. Coba kita pikirkan hal ini: berapa banyak situs web yang akan Anda lewatkan hari ini tanpa Debian? Dan yang lebih menarik, Debian adalah sistem operasi yang dipilih untuk digunakan pada Stasiun Luar Angkasa Internasional. Apakah Anda pernah mengikuti perkembangan dari astronot di Stasiun Luar Angkasa Internasional (ISS), mungkin melalui kehadiran jaringan sosial NASA atau organisasi internasional lainnya? Kedua hal itu sendiri dan tulisan tentang hal itu telah dimungkinkan oleh Debian. Perusahaan yang tak terhitung jumlahnya, universitas, dan administrasi publik bergantung pada Debian untuk pekerjaan mereka, memberikan layanan kepada jutaan pengguna di seluruh dunia... dan juga orbitnya!</para>

  <para>Tapi Debian jauh lebih dari sebuah sistem operasi, tidak peduli bagaimana kompleks, penuh fitur, dan dapat diandalkan sistem seperti bisa. Debian adalah visi kebebasan bahwa orang harus menikmati di dunia di mana semakin banyak kegiatan sehari-hari tergantung pada perangkat lunak. Debian lahir dari kardinal Software Gratis gagasan bahwa orang harus mengendalikan komputer mereka, dan bukan sebaliknya. Orang dengan pengetahuan software yang cukup harus dapat membongkar, memodifikasi, berkumpul kembali dan berbagi dengan orang lain semua perangkat lunak yang penting bagi mereka. Tidak masalah jika software yang digunakan untuk kegiatan sembarangan seperti posting gambar anak kucing di Web, atau untuk tugas-tugas yang berpotensi mengancam kehidupan seperti - mengemudikan mobil kami dan menyalakan perangkat medis untuk menyembuhkan kita - dan Debian digunakan dalam semua skenario di atas; Anda harus mengendalikannya. Orang tanpa pengetahuan software yang mendalam harus menikmati kebebasan tersebut juga: mereka harus dapat mendelegasikan kepada orang-orang pilihan mereka, orang yang mereka percaya, audit atau modifikasi perangkat-perangkat lunak berbasis atas nama mereka.</para>

  <para>In the quest for the control of people over machines, Free
  operating systems play a fundamental role: you cannot be in full
  control of a computer device if you do not control its operating
  system. This is where Debian's main ambition comes from: producing
  the best, entirely Free operating system. For more than 20 years
  now, Debian has both developed a Free operating system and promoted
  a vision of Free Software around it. In so doing, Debian has set a
  very high bar for software freedom advocates around the world.
  Debian's decisions on matters of software licensing, for example,
  are routinely looked to by international standard organizations,
  governments, and other Free Software projects, when deciding if
  something should be considered “free enough” or not.</para>

  <para>But this political vision is not yet enough to explain
  Debian's uniqueness. Debian is also a very peculiar social
  experiment, strongly attached to its independence. Think for a
  moment of other mainstream Free Software distributions, or even of
  popular <emphasis>proprietary</emphasis> operating systems. Chances
  are that you can associate each of them with a large company that is
  either the main development force behind the project, or at the very
  least the steward of all its non-development activities. Debian is
  different. Within the Debian Project volunteers pack on themselves
  the responsibilities of all the activities that are needed to keep
  Debian alive and kicking. The variety of those activities is
  stunning: from translations to system administration, from marketing
  to management, from conference organization to artwork design, from
  bookkeeping to legal issues... not to mention software packaging
  and development! Debian contributors take care of all of
  these.</para>

  <para>As a first consequence of this radical form of independence,
  Debian needs and relies on a very diverse community of volunteers.
  Any skill in any of the above areas, or others you can imagine, can
  be invested into Debian and will be used to improve the project. A
  second consequence of Debian independence is that Debian's choices
  can be trusted not to be driven by the commercial interests of
  specific companies — interests that we have no guarantee will always
  be aligned with the goal of promoting people's control over
  machines, as too many recent examples in the tech news
  testify.</para>

  <para>One last aspect contributes to Debian's uniqueness: the way in
  which the social experiment is run. Despite the folklore of being
  bureaucratic, decision making in Debian is in fact highly distributed.
  There exist clearly defined areas of responsibility within the
  project. People in charge of those areas are free to drive their own
  boat. As long as they keep up with the quality requirements agreed
  upon by the community, no one can tell them what to do or how to do
  their job. If you want to have a say on how something is done in
  Debian, you need to put yourself on the line and be ready to take the
  job on your shoulders. This peculiar form of meritocracy — which we
  sometimes call <emphasis>do-ocracy</emphasis> — is very empowering for
  contributors. Anyone with enough skills, time, and motivation can have
  a real impact on the direction the project is taking. This is
  testified by a population of about 1 000 official members of the
  Debian Project, and several thousands of contributors world-wide. It
  is no wonder that Debian is often credited as the largest
  community-driven Free Software project in existence.</para>

  <para>So Debian is quite unique. Are we the only ones noticing this?
  Definitely not. According to <ulink url="http://distrowatch.com/">DistroWatch</ulink> there are about
  300 active Free Software distributions around. Half of that (about
  140) are Debian <emphasis>derivatives</emphasis>. That means that
  they start from Debian, adapt it to fit the needs of their users —
  usually by adding, modifying, and rebuilding packages — and release
  the resulting product. In essence, derivatives apply the Free
  Software granted freedoms of modifying and redistributing copies not
  only to individual pieces of software, but to a distribution as a
  whole. The potential of reaching out to new Free Software users and
  contributors by the means of derivative distributions is huge. We
  believe that it is mainly thanks to that thriving ecosystem that
  Free Software is nowadays finally rivaling with proprietary software
  in fields which were historically considered hard to conquer, such
  as large desktop deployments. Debian sits at the root of the largest
  ecosystem of Free Software distributions in existence: even if you
  are not using Debian directly, and even if your distributor has not
  told you, chances are that you are benefiting right now from the
  work of the Debian community.</para>

  <para>But Debian's uniqueness sometimes comes with unexpected
  consequences. A consequence of Debian's vision on digital freedoms
  has been the need of redefining what we mean by
  <emphasis>software</emphasis>. The Debian Project has since long
  realized that, as part of an operating system, you need to
  distribute a lot of non-software material: music, images,
  documentation, raw data, firmware, etc. But how do you apply
  <emphasis>software</emphasis> freedoms to that material? Should we
  have different requirements or should all material be held up to the
  same high standard of freedom? The Debian Project has decided for
  the latter: all material shipped as part of Debian should offer the
  same freedoms to its users. Such a radical philosophical position
  has far reaching effects. It means we cannot distribute non-free
  firmware, or artwork not meant to be used in commercial settings, or
  books that cannot be modified in order to avoid tarnishing (as book
  publishers folklore goes) the author's/publisher's reputation.</para>

  <para>The book you have in your hands is different. It's a
  <emphasis>free as in freedom</emphasis> book, a book which is up to
  Debian freedom standards for every aspect of your digital life.
  For a very long time, the scarce availability of books like this one
  has been a significant shortcoming of Debian. It meant that
  there was little reading material that helped to spread Debian and its
  values, while at the same time embodying those values and showing
  off their advantages. But it also meant, ironically, that we had
  little such material that we could distribute as part of Debian
  itself. This is the first reputable book to address this
  shortcoming. You can <command>apt install</command> this book,
  you can redistribute it, you can fork this book or, better, submit
  bug reports and patches for it, so that others in the future can
  benefit from your contributions. The “maintainers” of this book —
  who are also its authors — are longstanding members of the Debian
  Project, who grok the freedom ethos that permeates every aspect of
  Debian and know first-hand what it means to take on the
  responsibility for important parts of Debian. By releasing this Free
  book they are doing, once more, such a wonderful service to the
  Debian community.</para>
