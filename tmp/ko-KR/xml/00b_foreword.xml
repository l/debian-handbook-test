		리눅스는 지난 몇년간 힘을 키워왔으며, 그리고 증가하는 유저의 수는 지속적으로 리눅스가 발전하도록 힘을 주고 있습니다. 리눅스를 선택하는데에 있어 첫번째 단계는 어떤 리눅스 계열을 사용하지 결정하는 겁니다. 이 단계가 중요한 이유는, 리눅스 계열마다 각자의 특징이 존재하며 처음부터 용도에 알맞은 것을 써야 나중에 다른 것으로 바꿀 수고를 들일 필요가 없기 때문입니다.

		똑부러지게 말하자면, 리눅스는 단지 하드웨어와 어플리케이션을 중계하는 일종의 소프트웨어인 커널에 불과합니다.
	</para>
	 <para>
		반면 "리눅스 계열"은 완전한 운영체제입니다. "리눅스 커널", 설치 프로그램, 그리고 컴퓨터가 작동하기 위해서 필요한 기초적인 소프트웨어를 포함한 것이라고 생각하시면 됩니다.

		데비안 GNU/리눅스는 대부분의 리눅스(계열) 사용자들이 이용하는 운영체제의 통칭이라고 부를 수 있습니다. 이 책을 쓴 이유 중 하나로는 여러분이 나중에 리눅스 계열 중 하나를 선택하실 때, 리눅스 계열의 다양한 정보를 제공하기 위해서입니다.

			Most Linux distributions are backed by a for-profit company that develops them and sells them under some kind of commercial scheme. Examples include <emphasis>Ubuntu</emphasis>, mainly developed by <emphasis>Canonical Ltd.</emphasis>; <emphasis>Red Hat Enterprise Linux</emphasis>, by <emphasis>Red Hat</emphasis>; and <emphasis>SUSE Linux</emphasis>, maintained and made commercially available by <emphasis>Novell</emphasis>.

			상업적 색이 강한 리눅스 계열들의 정반대에는 데비안과 아파치 소프트웨어 재단(개발용 아파치 웹 서버 운영)이 존재합니다. 데비안은 인터넷을 통해 프로젝트 기여자들이 함께 구현한 자유 소프트웨어 세계의 프로젝트입니다. 어떤 부분들은 누군가가 회사에서 돈을 받고 개발에 참여하기도 하지만, 그렇다고 프로젝트 전체적인 부분에 있어 특정 회사가 점유하는 것이 아니며, 순수히 프로젝트에 참여한 기여자보다 권한이 많은 것도 아닙니다.

			Linux has gathered a fair amount of media coverage over the years; it mostly benefits the distributions supported by a real marketing department — in other words, company-backed distributions (Ubuntu, Red Hat, SUSE, and so on). But Debian is far from being a marginal distribution; multiple studies have shown over the years that it is widely used both on servers and on desktops. This is particularly true among webservers where Debian and Ubuntu are the leading Linux distributions. <ulink type="block" url="https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/os-debian/all/all" />

			이 책을 쓰게된 계기는 당신이 데비안에 대해서 더 잘 아실수 있도록 하기 위함입니다. 저희가 1998년(원작자 1,Raphaël), 2000년(원작자 2,Roland)부터 함게해온 경험을 이 책을 통해서 나눌 수 있는 좋은 기회가 되었으면 바랍니다. 언젠가 당신도 데비안 개발에 같이 참여할 기회가 있길 바랍니다…

		 <para>
			2004년에 처음 만들어진 이 책은 단지 데비안만을 다룬 프랑스어 책이었습니다. 그 당시에는 이 책 이외에도 프랑스와 영어 독자를 대상으로 한 책도 많이 존재했습니다. 불행하게도 시간이 지남에 따라 개정판을 내놓은 책은 없었고, 데비안에 관한 좋은책들은 점차 사라져갔습니다. 저희는 이 책이 영어 이외에도 다른 언어로 번역되면서 데비안의 부족한 점도 채우고 많은 사용자에게도 도움이 되길바랍니다.

			당신이 찾아본 GNU/리눅스에 관한 문서들은 대부분 데비안과 관련되어 있습니다. 무료 소프트웨어라면 거의 데비안과 관련되었기 때문이죠. 그러나 데비안만이 아닌 다른 파생 계열 또한 특징이 있기 때문에, "데비안만의 방식"을 설명하고자 합니다.
		</para>
		 <para>
			단지 따르는 것도 흥미롭겠지만, "데비안 방식"의 근거를 아는 것이 데비안을 이해하는데 도움이 될 수 있습니다. 그래서 단지 형식적인 설명을 하기보다, 이 책에서는 자연스럽게 이해할 수 있도록 데비안의 프로젝트가 어떻게 진행되는지 설명할 것입니다.

			<emphasis role="strong">Chapter 1</emphasis> focuses on a non-technical presentation of the Debian project and describes its goals and organization. These aspects are important because they define a general framework that other chapters will complete with more concrete information.
		</para>
		 <para>
			<emphasis role="strong">Chapters 2 and 3</emphasis> provide a broad outline of the case study. At this point, novice readers can take the time to read <emphasis role="strong">appendix B</emphasis>, where they will find a short remedial course explaining a number of basic computing notions, as well as concepts inherent to any Unix system.

		 <para>
			To get on with our real subject matter, we will quite naturally start with the installation process (<emphasis role="strong">chapter 4</emphasis>); <emphasis role="strong">chapters 5 and 6</emphasis> will unveil basic tools that any Debian administrator will use, such as those of the <emphasis role="strong">APT</emphasis> family, which is largely responsible for the distribution's excellent reputation. These chapters are in no way restricted to professionals, since everyone is their own administrator at home.

			A Debian package is an archive containing all the files required to install a piece of software. It is generally a file with a <filename>.deb</filename> extension, and it can be handled with the <command>dpkg</command> command. Also called a <emphasis>binary package</emphasis>, it contains files that can be directly used (such as programs or documentation). On the other hand, a <emphasis>source package</emphasis> contains the source code for the software and the instructions required for building the binary package.

			The present version is already the eighth edition of the book (we include the first four that were only available in French). This edition covers version 9 of Debian, code-named <emphasis role="distribution">Stretch</emphasis>. Among the changes, Debian now sports a new architecture — <emphasis>mips64el</emphasis> for little-endian 64-bit MIPS processors. On the opposite side, the <emphasis>powerpc</emphasis> architecture has been dropped due to lack of volunteers to keep up with development (which itself can be explained by the fact that associated hardware is getting old and less interesting to work on). All included packages have obviously been updated, including the GNOME desktop, which is now in its version 3.22. Most executables have been rebuilt with PIE build flags thus enabling supplementary hardening measures (Address Space Layout Randomization, ASLR).

			<title>A Bit of History</title>
			 <para>
				In 2003, Nat Makarévitch contacted Raphaël because he wanted to publish a book on Debian in the <foreignphrase>Cahier de l'Admin</foreignphrase> (Admin's Handbook) collection that he was managing for Eyrolles, a leading French editor of technical books. Raphaël immediately accepted to write it. The first edition came out on 14th October 2004 and was a huge success — it was sold out barely four months later.
			</para>
			 <para>
				Since then, we have released 7 other editions of the French book, one for each subsequent Debian release. Roland, who started working on the book as a proofreader, gradually became its co-author.
			</para>
			 <para>
				While we were obviously satisfied with the book's success, we always hoped that Eyrolles would convince an international editor to translate it into English. We had received numerous comments explaining how the book helped people to get started with Debian, and we were keen to have the book benefit more people in the same way.
			</para>
			 <para>
				Alas, no English-speaking editor that we contacted was willing to take the risk of translating and publishing the book. Not put off by this small setback, we negotiated with our French editor Eyrolles and got back the necessary rights to translate the book into English and publish it ourselves. Thanks to a <ulink url="http://www.ulule.com/debian-handbook/">successful crowdfunding campaign</ulink>, we worked on the translation between December 2011 and May 2012. The “Debian Administrator's Handbook” was born and it was published under a free-software license!
			</para>
			 <para>
				While this was an important milestone, we already knew that the story would not be over for us until we could contribute the French book as an official translation of the English book. This was not possible at that time because the French book was still distributed commercially under a non-free license by Eyrolles.
			</para>
			 <para>
				In 2013, the release of Debian 7 gave us a good opportunity to discuss a new contract with Eyrolles. We convinced them that a license more in line with the Debian values would contribute to the book's success. That wasn't an easy deal to make, and we agreed to setup another <ulink url="http://www.ulule.com/liberation-cahier-admin-debian/">crowdfunding campaign</ulink> to cover some of the costs and reduce the risks involved. The operation was again a huge success and in July 2013, we added a French translation to the Debian Administrator's Handbook.
			</para>
			 <para>
				We would like to thank everybody who contributed to these fundraising campaigns, either by pledging some money or by passing the word around. We couldn't have done it without you.
			</para>
			 <para>
				To save some paper, 5 years after the fundraising campaigns and after two subsequent editions, we dropped the list of persons who opted to be rewarded with a mention of their name in the book. But their names are engraved in the acknowledgments of the Wheezy edition of the book: <ulink type="block" url="https://debian-handbook.info/browse/wheezy/sect.acknowledgments.html" />

			<title>Special Thanks to Contributors</title>
			 <para>
				This book would not be what it is without the contributions of several persons who each played an important role during the translation phase and beyond. We would like to thank Marilyne Brun, who helped us to translate the sample chapter and who worked with us to define some common translation rules. She also revised several chapters which were desperately in need of supplementary work. Thank you to Anthony Baldwin (of Baldwin Linguas) who translated several chapters for us.
			</para>
			 <para>
				We benefited from the generous help of proofreaders: Daniel Phillips, Gerold Rupprecht, Gordon Dey, Jacob Owens, and Tom Syroid. They each reviewed many chapters. Thank you very much!
			</para>
			 <para>
				Then, once the English version was liberated, of course we got plenty of feedback and suggestions and fixes from the readers, and even more from the many teams who undertook to translate this book into other languages. Thanks!
			</para>
			 <para>
				We would also like to thank the readers of the French book who provided us some nice quotes to confirm that the book was really worth being translated: thank you Christian Perrier, David Bercot, Étienne Liétart, and Gilles Roussi. Stefano Zacchiroli — who was Debian Project Leader during the crowdfunding campaign — also deserves a big thank you, he kindly endorsed the project with a quote explaining that free (as in freedom) books were more than needed.
			</para>
			 <para>
				If you have the pleasure to read these lines in a paperback copy of the book, then you should join us to thank Benoît Guillon, Jean-Côme Charpentier, and Sébastien Mengin who worked on the interior book design. Benoît is the upstream author of <ulink url="http://dblatex.sourceforge.net">dblatex</ulink> — the tool we used to convert DocBook into LaTeX (and then PDF). Sébastien is the designer who created this nice book layout and Jean-Côme is the LaTeX expert who implemented it as a stylesheet usable with dblatex. Thank you guys for all the hard work!
			</para>
			 <para>
				Finally, thank you to Thierry Stempfel for the nice pictures introducing each chapter, and thank you to Doru Patrascu for the beautiful book cover.
			</para>

		</section>
		 <section>
			<title>Thanks to Translators</title>
			 <para>
				Ever since the book has been freed, many volunteers have been busy translating it to numerous languages, such as Arabic, Brazilian Portuguese, German, Italian, Spanish, Japanese, Norwegian Bokmål, etc. Discover the full list of translations on the book's website: <ulink url="http://debian-handbook.info/get/#other" />

				We would like to thank all the translators and translation reviewers. Your work is highly appreciated because it brings Debian into the hands of millions of persons who cannot read English.

			<title>Personal Acknowledgments from Raphaël</title>
			 <para>
				First off, I would like to thank Nat Makarévitch, who offered me the possibility to write this book and who provided strong guidance during the year it took to get it done. Thank you also to the fine team at Eyrolles, and Muriel Shan Sei Fan in particular. She has been very patient with me and I learned a lot with her.
			</para>
			 <para>
				The period of the Ulule campaigns were very demanding for me but I would like to thank everybody who helped to make them a success, and in particular the Ulule team who reacted very quickly to my many requests. Thank you also to everybody who promoted the operations. I don't have any exhaustive list (and if I had it would probably be too long) but I would like to thank a few people who were in touch with me: Joey-Elijah Sneddon and Benjamin Humphrey of OMG! Ubuntu, Florent Zara of LinuxFr.org, Manu of Korben.info, Frédéric Couchet of April.org, Jake Edge of Linux Weekly News, Clement Lefebvre of Linux Mint, Ladislav Bodnar of Distrowatch, Steve Kemp of Debian-Administration.org, Christian Pfeiffer Jensen of Debian-News.net, Artem Nosulchik of LinuxScrew.com, Stephan Ramoin of Gandi.net, Matthew Bloch of Bytemark.co.uk, the team at Divergence FM, Rikki Kite of Linux New Media, Jono Bacon, the marketing team at Eyrolles, and numerous others that I have forgotten (sorry about that).
			</para>
			 <para>
				I would like to address a special thanks to Roland Mas, my co-author. We have been collaborating on this book since the start and he has always been up to the challenge. And I must say that completing the Debian Administrator's Handbook has been a lot of work…
			</para>
			 <para>
				Last but not least, thank you to my wife, Sophie. She has been very supportive of my work on this book and on Debian in general. There have been too many days (and nights) when I left her alone with our 2 sons to make some progress on the book. I am grateful for her support and know how lucky I am to have her.
			</para>

		</section>
		 <section>
			<title>Personal Acknowledgments from Roland</title>
			 <para>
				Well, Raphaël preempted most of my “external” thank-yous already. I am still going to emphasize my personal gratitude to the good folks at Eyrolles, with whom collaboration has always been pleasant and smooth. Hopefully the results of their excellent advice hasn't been lost in translation.
			</para>
			 <para>
				I am extremely grateful to Raphaël for taking on the administrative part of this English edition. From organizing the funding campaign to the last details of the book layout, producing a translated book is so much more than just translating and proofreading, and Raphaël did (or delegated and supervised) it all. So thanks.
			</para>
			 <para>
				Thanks also to all who more or less directly contributed to this book, by providing clarifications or explanations, or translating advice. They are too many to mention, but most of them can usually be found on various #debian-* IRC channels.
			</para>
			 <para>
				There is of course some overlap with the previous set of people, but specific thanks are still in order for the people who actually do Debian. There wouldn't be much of a book without them, and I am still amazed at what the Debian project as a whole produces and makes available to any and all.
			</para>
			 <para>
				More personal thanks go to my friends and my clients, for their understanding when I was less responsive because I was working on this book, and also for their constant support, encouragement and egging on. You know who you are; thanks.
			</para>
			 <para>
				And finally; I am sure they would be surprised by being mentioned here, but I would like to extend my gratitude to Terry Pratchett, Jasper Fforde, Tom Holt, William Gibson, Neal Stephenson, and of course the late Douglas Adams. The countless hours I spent enjoying their books are directly responsible for my being able to take part in translating one first and writing new parts later.
