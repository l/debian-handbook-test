			Virtualization is one of the most major advances in the recent years of computing. The term covers various abstractions and techniques simulating virtual computers with a variable degree of independence on the actual hardware. One physical server can then host several systems working at the same time and in isolation. Applications are many, and often derive from this isolation: test environments with varying configurations for instance, or separation of hosted services across different virtual machines for security.

              class="indexterm"></a> is a “paravirtualization” solution. It introduces a thin abstraction layer, called a “hypervisor”, between the hardware and the upper systems; this acts as a referee that controls access to hardware from the virtual machines. However, it only handles a few of the instructions, the rest is directly executed by the hardware on behalf of the systems. The main advantage is that performances are not degraded, and systems run close to native speed; the drawback is that the kernels of the operating systems one wishes to use on a Xen hypervisor need to be adapted to run on Xen.

				Xen was initially developed as a set of patches that lived out of the official tree, and not integrated to the Linux kernel.

				In order to avoid the hassle of selecting these components by hand, a few convenience packages (such as <span

During the installation of all that, configuration scripts also create a new entry in the Grub bootloader menu, so as to start the chosen kernel in a Xen dom0. Note however that this entry is not usually set to be the first one in the list, and will therefore not be selected by default. If that is not the desired behavior, the following commands will change it:

				Before turning these virtual machines on, we need to define how they'll be accessed. They can of course be considered as isolated machines, only accessed through their system console, but this rarely matches the usage pattern. Most of the time, a domU will be considered as a remote server, and accessed only through a network. However, it would be quite inconvenient to add a network card for each domU; which is why Xen allows creating virtual interfaces, that each domain can see and use in a standard way. Note that these cards, even though they're virtual, will only be useful once connected to a network, even a virtual one. Xen has several network models for that:

				Once the domU is up, it can be used just like any other server (since it is a GNU/Linux system after all). However, its virtual machine status allows some extra features. For instance, a domU can be temporarily paused then resumed, with the <code

              class="command">xl unpause</code> commands. Note that even though a paused domU does not use any processor power, its allocated memory is still in use. It may be interesting to consider the <code
              class="command">xl save</code> and <code
              class="command">xl restore</code> commands: saving a domU frees the resources that were previously used by this domU, including RAM. When restored (or unpaused, for that matter), a domU doesn't even notice anything beyond the passage of time. If a domU was running when the dom0 is shut down, the packaged scripts automatically save the domU, and restore it on the next boot. This will of course involve the standard inconvenience incurred when hibernating a laptop computer, for instance; in particular, if the domU is suspended for too long, network connections may expire. Note also that Xen is so far incompatible with a large part of ACPI power management, which precludes suspending the host (dom0) system.

				Even though it is used to build “virtual machines”, LXC is not, strictly speaking, a virtualization system, but a system to isolate groups of processes from each other even though they all run on the same host. It takes advantage of a set of recent evolutions in the Linux kernel, collectively known as <span
              class="emphasis"><em>control groups</em></span>, by which different sets of processes called “groups” have different views of certain aspects of the overall system. Most notable among these aspects are the process identifiers, the network configuration, and the mount points. Such a group of isolated processes will not have any access to the other processes in the system, and its accesses to the filesystem can be restricted to a specific subset. It can also have its own network interface and routing table, and it may be configured to only see a subset of the available devices present on the system.

				These features can be combined to isolate a whole process family starting from the <code

              class="emphasis"><em>LinuX Containers</em></span>), but a rather important difference with “real” virtual machines such as provided by Xen or KVM is that there's no second kernel; the container uses the very same kernel as the host system. This has both pros and cons: advantages include excellent performance due to the total lack of overhead, and the fact that the kernel has a global vision of all the processes running on the system, so the scheduling can be more efficient than it would be if two independent kernels were to schedule different task sets. Chief among the inconveniences is the impossibility to run a different kernel in a container (whether a different Linux version or a different operating system altogether).

In the typical case, each container will get a virtual network interface, connected to the real network through a bridge. This virtual interface can be plugged either directly onto the host's physical network interface (in which case the container is directly on the network), or onto another virtual interface defined on the host (and the host can then filter or route traffic).

An interesting side-effect is that the processes will then use less physical memory, since the kernel is able to detect that the programs are shared.
