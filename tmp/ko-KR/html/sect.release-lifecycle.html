				Otherwise, this distribution frequently houses important modifications to base packages, whose integration into <span
              class="distribution distribution">Unstable</span> with serious bugs would have critical repercussions. It is, thus, a completely isolated distribution, its packages never migrate to another version (except by direct, express intervention of the maintainer or the ftpmasters). It is also not self-contained: only a subset of the existing packages are present in <span
              class="distribution distribution">Experimental</span>, and it generally does not include the base system. This distribution is therefore mostly useful in combination with another, self-contained, distribution such as <span

				Let us turn back to the case of a typical package. The maintainer creates an initial package, which they compile for the <span

              class="literal">ftp-master.debian.org</code> server. This first event involves inspection and validation from the ftpmasters. The software is then available in the <span
              class="distribution distribution">Unstable</span> distribution, which is the “cutting edge” distribution chosen by users who are more concerned with having up to date packages than worried about serious bugs. They discover the program and then test it.

				Every newly updated package is updated on all Debian mirrors around the world within six hours. The users then test the corrections and search for other problems resulting from the modifications. Several updates may then occur rapidly. During these times, autobuilder robots come into action. Most frequently, the maintainer has only one traditional PC and has compiled their package on the amd64 (or i386) architecture (or they opted for a source-only upload, thus without any precompiled package); the autobuilders take over and automatically compile versions for all the other architectures. Some compilations may fail; the maintainer will then receive a bug report indicating the problem, which is then to be corrected in the next versions. When the bug is discovered by a specialist for the architecture in question, the bug report may come with a patch ready to use.

				While very interesting in principle, <span

With packages all depending upon each other, it is sometimes necessary to migrate a large number of packages simultaneously, which is impossible when some are uploading updates regularly. On the other hand, the script identifying the families of related packages works hard to create them (this would be an NP-complete problem, for which, fortunately, we know some good heuristics). This is why we can manually interact with and guide this script by suggesting groups of packages, or imposing the inclusion of certain packages in a group, even if this temporarily breaks some dependencies. This functionality is accessible to the Release Managers and their assistants.

				Recall that an NP-complete problem is of an exponential algorithmic complexity according to the size of the data, here being the length of the code (the number of figures) and the elements involved. The only way to resolve it is frequently to examine all possible configurations, which could require enormous means. A heuristic is an approximate, but satisfying, solution.

				This Long Term Support (LTS) of Debian releases is a recent initiative: individual contributors and companies joined forces to create the Debian LTS team. Older releases which are no longer supported by the Debian security team fall under the responsibility of this new team.

				The Debian security team handles security support in the current <span
              class="distribution distribution">Stable</span> release and also in the <span
              class="distribution distribution">Oldstable</span> release (but only for as long as is needed to ensure one year of overlap with the current stable release). This amounts roughly to three years of support for each release. The Debian LTS team handles the last (two) years of security support so that each releases benefits from at least 5 years of support and so that users can upgrade from version N to N+2. <div

				Long Term Support is a difficult commitment to make in Debian because volunteers tend to avoid the work that is not very fun. And providing security support for 5 years old software is — for many contributors — a lot less fun than packaging new upstream versions or developing new features.

				To bring this project to life, the project counted on the fact that long term support was particularly relevant for companies and that they would be willing to mutualize the cost of this security support.

				The project started in June 2014: some organizations allowed their employees to contribute part-time to Debian LTS while others preferred to sponsor the project with money so that Debian contributors get paid to do the work that they would not do for free. Most Debian contributors willing to be paid to work on LTS got together to create a clear sponsorship offer managed by Freexian (Raphaël Hertzog's company): <div
