			APT is a C++ program whose code mainly resides in the <code

				The advanced features of <code
                class="command">aptitude</code> are also available on the command-line. You can use the same package search patterns as in the interactive version. For example, if you want to cleanup the list of “manually installed” packages, and if you know that none of the locally installed programs require any particular libraries or Perl modules, you can mark the corresponding packages as automatic with a single command:
			</div><pre

              class="para">
					Another interesting feature of <code
                class="command">aptitude</code> is the fact that it respects recommendations between packages while still giving users the choice not to install them on a case by case basis. For example, the <span
                class="pkg pkg">gnome</span> package recommends <span
                class="pkg pkg">gdebi</span> (among others). When you select the former for installation, the latter will also be selected (and marked as automatic if not already installed on the system). Typing <span
                class="keycap"><strong>g</strong></span> will make it obvious: <span
                class="pkg pkg">gdebi</span> appears on the summary screen of pending actions in the list of packages installed automatically to satisfy dependencies. However, you can decide not to install it by deselecting it before confirming the operations.
				</div><div
              class="para">
					Note that this recommendation tracking feature does not apply to upgrades. For instance, if a new version of <span
                class="pkg pkg">gnome</span> recommends a package that it did not recommend formerly, the package won't be marked for installation. However, it will be listed on the upgrade screen so that the administrator can still select it for installation.
				</div><div
              class="para">
					Suggestions between packages are also taken into account, but in a manner adapted to their specific status. For example, since <span
                class="pkg pkg">gnome</span> suggests <span
                class="pkg pkg">dia-gnome</span>, the latter will be displayed on the summary screen of pending actions (in the section of packages suggested by other packages). This way, it is visible and the administrator can decide whether to take the suggestion into account or not. Since it is only a suggestion and not a dependency or a recommendation, the package will not be selected automatically — its selection requires a manual intervention from the user (thus, the package will not be marked as automatic).
				</div><div
              class="para">
					In the same spirit, remember that <code
                class="command">aptitude</code> makes intelligent use of the concept of task. Since tasks are displayed as categories in the screens of packages lists, you can either select a full task for installation or removal, or browse the list of packages included in the task to select a smaller subset.
				</div></div><div
            class="section"><div
              class="titlepage"><div><div><h4

              class="para">
					To conclude this section, let's note that <code
                class="command">aptitude</code> has more elaborate algorithms compared to <code
                class="command">apt-get</code> when it comes to resolving difficult situations. When a set of actions is requested and when these combined actions would lead to an incoherent system, <code
                class="command">aptitude</code> evaluates several possible scenarios and presents them in order of decreasing relevance. However, these algorithms are not failproof. Fortunately there is always the possibility to manually select the actions to perform. When the currently selected actions lead to contradictions, the upper part of the screen indicates a number of “broken” packages (and you can directly navigate to those packages by pressing <span
                class="keycap"><strong>b</strong></span>). It is then possible to manually build a solution for the problems found. In particular, you can get access to the different available versions by simply selecting the package with <span
                class="keycap"><strong>Enter</strong></span>. If the selection of one of these versions solves the problem, you should not hesitate to use the function. When the number of broken packages gets down to zero, you can safely go to the summary screen of pending actions for a last check before you apply them.

                  class="filename">/var/log/aptitude</code>). However, since both commands work at a very different level, you cannot find the same information in their respective logfiles. While <code
