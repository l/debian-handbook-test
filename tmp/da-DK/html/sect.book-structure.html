			A Debian package is an archive containing all the files required to install a piece of software. It is generally a file with a <code

			The present version is already the eighth edition of the book (we include the first four that were only available in French). This edition covers version 9 of Debian, code-named <span
            class="distribution distribution">Stretch</span>. Among the changes, Debian now sports a new architecture — <span
            class="emphasis"><em>mips64el</em></span> for little-endian 64-bit MIPS processors. On the opposite side, the <span
            class="emphasis"><em>powerpc</em></span> architecture has been dropped due to lack of volunteers to keep up with development (which itself can be explained by the fact that associated hardware is getting old and less interesting to work on). All included packages have obviously been updated, including the GNOME desktop, which is now in its version 3.22. Most executables have been rebuilt with PIE build flags thus enabling supplementary hardening measures (Address Space Layout Randomization, ASLR).
