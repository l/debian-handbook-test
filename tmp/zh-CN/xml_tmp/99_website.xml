      The book is freely available because we want everybody to benefit
      from it. That said maintaining it for each new Debian release takes
      time and lots of effort, and we appreciate being thanked for this.
      If you find this book valuable, please consider contributing to its
      continued maintenance either by buying a paperback copy or by making
      a donation via the form below (after having completed your donation,
      you will be automatically directed to the download page).

      The PDF format is the document corresponding to the printed book.
      It's not suitable for reading on small screens. The EPUB format is
      the recommended format if your reading devices supports it (most
      smartphones and many ebook readers do support it). The Mobipocket
      format is mainly for ebook readers that do not support EPUB (like
      the Kindle).
