    <para>初次配置图形界面可能不太顺利，新上市的显卡通常不能被 Debian 稳定版中附带的 X.org 完美支持。</para>

    <para>A brief reminder: X.org is the software component that allows
    graphical applications to display windows on screen. It includes a
    driver that makes efficient use of the video card. The features offered
    to the graphical applications are exported through a standard
    interface, <emphasis>X11</emphasis> (<emphasis role="distribution">Stretch</emphasis> contains version
    <emphasis>X11R7.7</emphasis>).</para>

    <sidebar>
      <title><emphasis>观点</emphasis> X11, XFree86 and X.org</title>

      <para>X11 is the graphical system most widely used on Unix-like
      systems (also available for
      Windows and Mac OS). Strictly speaking, the term “X11” only
      refers to a protocol specification, but it is also used to refer to
      the implementation in practice.</para>

      <para>X11 had a rough start, but the 1990s saw XFree86 emerge as the
      reference implementation because it was free software, portable, and
      maintained by a collaborative community. However, the rate of
      evolution slowed down near the end when the software only gained new
      drivers. That situation, along with a very controversial license
      change, led to the X.org fork in 2004. This is now the reference
      implementation, and Debian <emphasis role="distribution">Stretch</emphasis> uses X.org version 7.7.</para>
    </sidebar>

    <para>Current versions of X.org are able to autodetect the available
    hardware: this applies to the video card and the monitor, as well as
    keyboards and mice; in fact, it is so convenient that the package no
    longer even creates a <filename>/etc/X11/xorg.conf</filename>
    configuration file.</para>
    <indexterm><primary>解析度</primary></indexterm>

    <para>键盘的配置保存在 <filename>/etc/default/keyboard</filename>。该文件用于配置文本控制台也用于图形界面，由<emphasis role="pkg">keyboard-configuration</emphasis> 处理。配置键盘布局的细节在<xref linkend="sect.keyboard-config" />中。</para>

    <para><emphasis role="pkg">xserver-xorg-core</emphasis> 软件包提供X.org 7.x系列的通用X 服务。该服务是模块化的并使用一套相互独立的驱动来处理很多不同类型的显卡。安装 <emphasis role="pkg">xserver-xorg</emphasis> 确保服务和至少一种显卡驱动被安装。</para>
    <indexterm><primary>服务</primary><secondary>X</secondary></indexterm>
    <indexterm><primary><emphasis role="pkg">xserver-xorg</emphasis></primary></indexterm>

    <para>Note that if the detected video card is not handled by any
    of the available drivers, X.org tries using the VESA and fbdev
    drivers. VESA is a generic driver that should work
    everywhere, but with limited capabilities (fewer available
    resolutions, no hardware acceleration for games and visual effects
    for the desktop, and so on) while fbdev works on top of the
    kernel's framebuffer device. Nowadays the X server runs without
    any administrative privileges (this used to be required to be able
    to configure the screen) and thus its log file is now stored
    in the user's home directory in <filename>~/.local/share/xorg/Xorg.0.log</filename>
    (whereas it used to be in <filename>/var/log/Xorg.0.log</filename>
    for versions older than <emphasis role="distribution">Stretch</emphasis>).
    That log file is where one would look to know what driver is currently
    in use. For example, the following snippet matches what the
    <literal>intel</literal> driver outputs when it is loaded:</para>

    <programlisting>
(==) Matched intel as autoconfigured driver 0
(==) Matched modesetting as autoconfigured driver 1
(==) Matched vesa as autoconfigured driver 2
(==) Matched fbdev as autoconfigured driver 3
(==) Assigned the driver to the xf86ConfigLayout
(II) LoadModule: "intel"
(II) Loading /usr/lib/xorg/modules/drivers/intel_drv.so</programlisting>

      <title><emphasis>其他</emphasis> 专利驱动</title>

      <para>有些显卡制造商（特别是nVidia）拒绝发布其产品的硬件规格，而编写良好的自由驱动程序需要这些规格。他们提供专用驱动支持其硬件。这种政策是极其恶毒的，因为即使有驱动，但是却不能很好的工作；更重要的是，它不会随着X.org 更新而更新，这就会导致最新的驱动加载出问题（并非所有）。建议尽量避免选择这些生产商，选择那些更合作的厂家。</para>

      <para>If you still end up with such a card, you will find the
      required packages in the <emphasis>non-free</emphasis> section:
      <emphasis role="pkg">nvidia-driver</emphasis> for nVidia cards.
      It requires a matching kernel module. Building the module can be
      automated by installing the package <emphasis role="pkg">nvidia-kernel-dkms</emphasis> (for nVidia).</para>

      <para>The “nouveau” project aims to develop a free software
        driver for nVidia cards and is the default driver that you get
        for nVidia cards in Debian. As of <emphasis role="distribution">Stretch</emphasis>, its feature set and performance do not
      match the proprietary driver. In the developers' defense, we should
      mention that the required information can only be gathered by reverse
      engineering, which makes things difficult. The free driver for ATI
      video cards, called “radeon”, is much better in that
      regard although it often requires non-free firmware.</para>

      <para>The graphical interface only provides display
      space. Running the X server by itself only leads to an empty
      screen, which is why most installations use a <emphasis>display
      manager</emphasis> to display a user authentication screen and
      start the graphical desktop once the user has authenticated. The
      three most popular display managers in current use are <emphasis role="pkg">gdm3</emphasis> (<foreignphrase>GNOME Display
      Manager</foreignphrase>), <emphasis role="pkg">sddm</emphasis>
      (suggested for KDE Plasma) and
      <emphasis role="pkg">lightdm</emphasis> (<foreignphrase>Light Display
      Manager</foreignphrase>). Since the Falcot Corp administrators
      have opted to use the GNOME desktop environment, they logically
      picked <command>gdm3</command> as a display manager too. The
      <filename>/etc/gdm3/daemon.conf</filename> configuration file
      has many options (the list can be found in the
      <filename>/usr/share/gdm/gdm.schemas</filename> schema file)
      to control its behaviour while
      <filename>/etc/gdm3/greeter.dconf-defaults</filename> contains
      settings for the greeter “session” (more than just a login
      window, it is a limited desktop with power management and
      accessibility related tools). Note that some of the most
      useful settings for end-users can be tweaked with GNOME's
      control center.</para>

      <title>选择窗口管理器</title>

      <para>Since each graphical desktop provides its own window
      manager, which window manager you choose is usually influenced by
      which desktop you have selected.  GNOME uses the
      <command>mutter</command> window
      manager, Plasma uses <command>kwin</command>, and Xfce (which
      we present later) has <command>xfwm</command>. The Unix
      philosophy always allows using one's window manager of choice,
      but following the recommendations allows an administrator to
      best take advantage of the integration efforts led by each
      project.</para>

	<para>The window manager displays the “decorations” around
	the windows belonging to the currently running applications, which
	includes frames and the title bar. It also allows reducing,
	restoring, maximizing, and hiding windows. Most window managers
	also provide a menu that pops up when the desktop is clicked in a
	specific way. This menu provides the means to close the window
	manager session, start new applications, and in some cases,
	change to another window manager (if installed).</para>
      </sidebar>

      <para>Older computers may, however, have a hard time running
      heavyweight graphical desktop environments. In these cases, a lighter
      configuration should be used. “Light” (or small footprint) window
      managers include WindowMaker (in the <emphasis role="pkg">wmaker</emphasis> package), Afterstep, fvwm, icewm,
      blackbox, fluxbox, or openbox. In these cases, the system should be configured so that the
      appropriate window manager gets precedence; the standard way is to
      change the <command>x-window-manager</command> alternative with the
      command <command>update-alternatives --config x-window-manager</command>.</para>

	<para>Debian 政策列出了一系列标准命令来运行特殊命令。例如， <command>x-window-manager</command> 唤起窗口管理器。但是Debian 并没用将该命令指派给某个固定的窗口管理器。管理员可以选择唤起哪个管理器。</para>

      <para>Modern desktop environments and many window managers provide
      menus listing the available applications for the user. In order to
      keep menus up-to-date in relation to the actual set of available
      applications, each package usually provides a <filename>.desktop</filename>
      file in <filename>/usr/share/applications</filename>. The format
      of those files has been standardized by FreeDesktop.org:
      <ulink type="block" url="https://standards.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/latest/" />

      <para>
        The applications menus can be further customized by administrators through
        system-wide configuration files as described by the “Desktop Menu Specification”.
        End-users can also customize the menus with graphical tools such
        as <emphasis role="pkg">kmenuedit</emphasis> (in Plasma),

        <para>
          Historically — way before the FreeDesktop.org standards emerged — Debian
          had invented its own menu system where each package provided a generic
          description of the desired menu entries in
          <filename>/usr/share/menu/</filename>. This tool is still available
          in Debian (in the <emphasis role="pkg">menu</emphasis> package)
          but it is only marginally useful since package maintainers are
          encouraged to rely on <filename>.desktop</filename> files
          instead.

    <title>图形桌面</title>

    <para>The free graphical desktop field is dominated by two large
    software collections: GNOME and Plasma by KDE. Both of them are very popular.
    This is rather a rare instance in the free software world; the Apache
    web server, for instance, has very few peers.</para>

    <indexterm><primary>Qt</primary></indexterm>

    <para>This diversity is rooted in history. Plasma (initially only KDE,
    which is now the name of the community) was the first graphical desktop
    project, but it chose the Qt graphical toolkit and that choice
    wasn't acceptable for a large number of developers. Qt was not free
    software at the time, and GNOME was started based on the GTK+ toolkit.
    Qt has since become free software, but the projects still evolved in
    parallel.</para>

    <para>The GNOME and KDE communities still work together: under the FreeDesktop.org
    umbrella, the projects collaborated in defining standards for
    interoperability across applications.</para>
    <indexterm><primary>FreeDesktop.org</primary></indexterm>

    <para>如何选择“最好”的图形桌面是我们想要弄明白，但又很敏感的话题。这里只介绍各种可能性并给一些指引。最好的选择莫过于亲身实验之后的选择。</para>

    <section id="sect.gnome-desktop">
      <title>GNOME</title>

      <para>Debian <emphasis role="distribution">Stretch</emphasis>
      includes GNOME version 3.22, which can be installed by a simple
      <command>apt install gnome</command> (it can also be installed by
      selecting the “Debian desktop environment” task).</para>
      <indexterm><primary><emphasis role="pkg">gnome</emphasis></primary></indexterm>

      <para>GNOME is noteworthy for its efforts in usability and
      accessibility. Design professionals have been involved in writing
      its standards and recommendations, which has helped developers to create
      satisfying graphical user interfaces. The project also gets
      encouragement from the big players of computing, such as Intel, IBM,
      Oracle, Novell, and of course, various Linux distributions. Finally,
      many programming languages can be used in developing applications
      interfacing to GNOME.</para>

      </figure>

      <para>For administrators, GNOME seems to be better prepared for
      massive deployments. Application configuration is handled through
      the GSettings interface and stores its data in the DConf database.
      The configuration settings can thus be queried and edited with the
      <command>gsettings</command>, and <command>dconf</command>
      command-line tools, or by the <command>dconf-editor</command>
      graphical user interfaces. The administrator can therefore change
      users' configuration with a simple script. The GNOME website
      provides information to guide administrators who
      manage GNOME workstations:

      <command>apt install kde-standard</command>.</para>

      <para>Plasma has had a rapid evolution based on a very hands-on
      approach. Its authors quickly got very good results, which allowed
      them to grow a large user-base. These factors contributed to the

      <para>Since the Qt 4.0 release, the last remaining license problem
      with KDE software has been solved. This version was released under the GPL both
      for Linux and Windows (the Windows version was previously

      <para>Unlike GNOME and Plasma, Xfce does not aim to become a vast
      project. Beyond the basic components of a modern desktop (file
      manager, window manager, session manager, a panel for application
      launchers and so on), it only provides a few specific applications: 
      a terminal, a calendar (Orage), an image viewer, a CD/DVD burning tool,
      a media player (Parole), sound volume control and a text editor (mousepad).

      <para>
        Mozilla has a very fast-paced release cycle for Firefox. New
        releases are published every six to eight weeks and only the
        latest version is supported for security issues. This doesn't
        suit all kind of users so, every 10 cycles, they are promoting
        one of their release to an <emphasis>Extended Support Release</emphasis>
        (ESR) which will get security updates (and no functional changes)
        during the next 10 cycles (which covers a bit more than a year).
      </para>
      <para>
        Debian has both versions packaged. The ESR one, in the package
        <emphasis role="pkg">firefox-esr</emphasis>, is used by default
        since it is the only version suitable for Debian <emphasis role="distribution">Stable</emphasis> with its long support
        period (and even there Debian has to upgrade from
        one ESR release to the next multiple times during a Debian Stable
        lifecycle). The regular Firefox is available in the
        <emphasis role="pkg">firefox</emphasis> package but it is only
        available to users of Debian
        <emphasis role="distribution">Unstable</emphasis>.

      <para>Before Debian <emphasis role="distribution">Stretch</emphasis>,
	Firefox and Thunderbird were missing. The <emphasis role="pkg">iceweasel</emphasis> package contained Iceweasel,
	which was basically Firefox under another name.</para>

      <para>The rationale behind this renaming was a result of the usage
      rules imposed by the Mozilla Foundation on the
      <trademark>Firefox</trademark> registered trademark: any software
      named Firefox had to use the official Firefox logo and icons.
      However, since these elements are not released under a free
      license, Debian could not distribute them in its
      <emphasis>main</emphasis> section. Rather than moving the whole
      browser to <emphasis>non-free</emphasis>, the package maintainer
      choose to use a different name.</para>

      <para>出于类似的原因， <trademark>Thunderbird（雷鸟）</trademark> 邮件客户端被重命名为 Icedove （冰鸽）。</para>

      <para>
        Nowadays, the logo and icons are distributed under a free software
        license and Mozilla recognized that the changes made by the Debian
        project are respecting their trademark license so Debian is again able
        to ship Mozilla's applications under their official name.

      <para>Netscape Navigator was the standard browser when the web started

      which forbade them from pre-installing Netscape Navigator. Faced with
      this failure, Netscape (the company) decided to “free” its source
      code, by releasing it under a free license, to give it a second
      life. This was the beginning of the Mozilla project. After many
      years of development, the results are more than satisfying: the
      Mozilla project brought forth an HTML rendering engine (called
      Gecko) that is among the most standard-compliant. This rendering
      engine is in particular used by the Mozilla Firefox browser, which
      is one of the most successful browsers, with a fast-growing user

    Its clear purpose is to make web services more attractive, both by

      is a long list of groupware packages that were once available
      in Debian but have been dropped for lack of maintainers
      or incompatibility with other (newer) software in Debian.
      This has been the case with PHPGroupware, eGroupware, and

      <para>FusionForge 是一个协作开发工具，有一些原型在 SourceForge（一个给自由软件提供宿主服务的项目）上。使用自由软件标准开发模型。在 SourceForge 的代码专有后，它自身保持进化。最初的作者 VA Software决定不再发布任何自由版本。当第一个分支（GForge）发展的时候，同样的事情发生了。由于各种个人和组织都参与了开发，而且项目不纯用于软件开发，当前的 FusionForge 也包含了传统开发方式所使用的一些特性。</para>
      <indexterm><primary>SourceForge</primary></indexterm>

      <para>FusionForge 可以看作是多种用于项目管理，追踪和协作的工具集合。这些工具可以粗略的分成三大块：</para>
      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para><emphasis>communication</emphasis>: web forums,
	  mailing-list manager, and announcement system allowing a project to
	  publish news</para>

	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>Since FusionForge largely targets development projects,
      it also integrates many tools such as CVS, Subversion, Git, Bazaar,
      Darcs, Mercurial and Arch for source control management (also called
      “configuration management” or “version control”). These programs keep a
      history of all the
      revisions of all tracked files (often source code files), with all
      the changes they go through, and they can merge modifications when
      several developers work simultaneously on the same part of a
      project.</para>

      <para>Most of these tools can be accessed or even managed through
      a web interface, with a fine-grained permission system, and email
      notifications for some events.</para>

      <para>
        Unfortunately, FusionForge is not part of Debian <emphasis role="distribution">Stretch</emphasis>. It is a large software

    <para>Office software has long been seen as lacking in the free
    software world. Users require replacements for
    Microsoft tools such as Word and Excel, but these are so complex
    that replacements were hard to develop. The situation changed
    when Sun released the StarOffice code under a free license as OpenOffice, a
    project which later gave birth to Libre Office, which is available on
    Debian.
    The KDE project also has its own office suite, called Calligra Suite
    (previously KOffice), and GNOME, while never offering a comprehensive
    office suite, provides AbiWord as a word processor and Gnumeric as a
    spreadsheet. The various projects each have their strengths. For instance,
    the Gnumeric spreadsheet is better than OpenOffice.org/Libre Office in some
    domains, notably the precision of its calculations. On the word processing
    front, the Libre Office suite still leads the way.</para>

    <para>Another important feature for users is the ability to

      <para>OpenOffice.org contributors set up a foundation
      (<emphasis>The Document Foundation</emphasis>) to foster the project's
      development. The idea had been discussed for some time, but the
      actual trigger was Oracle's acquisition of Sun. The new ownership
      made the future of OpenOffice under Oracle uncertain. Since Oracle
      declined to join the foundation, the developers had to give up on
      the OpenOffice.org name. This office suite is now known as
      <emphasis>Libre Office</emphasis>, and is available in Debian.</para>

      <para>After a period of relative stagnation on OpenOffice.org, Oracle
      donated the code and associated rights to the Apache Software Foundation,
      and OpenOffice is now an Apache project. This project is not currently
      available in Debian and is rather moribund when compared to Libre Office.</para>

     video through firewalls and NAT networks. Users may receive
     ghost calls (their phone rings but they don't hear the other person)
     or they may not be able to call at all.</para>

     <para>The ICE and TURN protocols were developed to resolve these issues.
     Operating a TURN server with public IP addresses in each site and
     using client software that supports both ICE and TURN gives the
     best user experience.</para>

     <para>If the client software is only intended for instant messaging,
     there is no requirement for ICE or TURN support.</para>

    <para>Debian Developers operate a community SIP service at
    <ulink url="https://rtc.debian.org">rtc.debian.org</ulink>.
    The community maintains a wiki with documentation about setting
    up many of the client applications packaged in Debian.  The wiki articles
    and screenshots are a useful resource for anybody setting up a similar
    service on their own domain.

     <title><emphasis>选择</emphasis> 互联网聊天室（IRC）</title>

     <para>除了 SIP 和 XMPP 之外，也可以考虑 IRC。这种系统以频道集中，频道名以井号 <literal>#</literal>开始。每个频道通常讨论一个特定的话题，任意数量的人都可以加入一个讨论频道（但是如果有需求，用户也可以进行一对一的私聊）。IRC 协议已经比较老了，并且不支持端到端的消息加密；仍然可以在用户和服务器之间通过 SSL 隧道内部加密 IRC 协议。</para>
     <indexterm><primary>IRC</primary></indexterm>
     <indexterm><primary><foreignphrase>Internet Relay Chat</foreignphrase></primary></indexterm>

     <para>IRC 客户端稍微有点复杂，在公司环境中它们所能提供许多限制特性。例如，如果正常讨论被扰乱，频道“操作者”可以将用户踢出去，甚至永久封账户。</para>

     <para>Since the IRC protocol is very old, many clients are available
       to cater for many user groups; examples include XChat (only
       available in <emphasis role="distribution">stretch-backports</emphasis>,
       not in <emphasis role="distribution">stretch</emphasis>), and Smuxi
       (graphical clients based on GTK+), Irssi (text mode), Circe
       (integrated to Emacs), and so on.</para>

     <title><emphasis>快速浏览</emphasis> Ekiga 视频会议</title>

     <para>Ekiga（前身 GnomeMeeting）是 Linux 系统上主流的视频会议软件。它既稳定又不乏功能性，并且在局域网中非常好用；如果防火墙缺乏对 H323 和 SIP 电话会议协议的支持，那么在广域网中配置该服务就比较复杂。</para>
     <indexterm><primary>视频会议</primary></indexterm>
     <indexterm><primary>H323</primary></indexterm>

     <para>如果只有一个 Ekiga 客户端在防火墙后面运行，配置就比较直接，只需将几个端口转发到指定的主机：TCP 端口 1720 （侦听接入连接），TCP 端口 5060（用于 SIP），TCP 端口 30000 到 30010 （用于控制和开启连接），UDP 端口 5000 到 5100（用于音频和视频数据传输及注册 H323 代理）。</para>

     <para>当有几个 Ekiga 客户端在防火墙后运行，复杂性大大增加了。必须设置一个 H323 代理（例如 <emphasis role="pkg">gnugk</emphasis> 软件包），它的配置可不简单。</para>
