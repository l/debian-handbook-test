			The Debian package is not only an archive of files intended for installation. It is part of a larger whole, and it describes its relationship with other Debian packages (dependencies, conflicts, suggestions). It also provides scripts that enable the execution of commands at different stages in the package's lifecycle (installation, removal, upgrades). These data are used by the package management tools but are not part of the packaged software; they are, within the package, what is called its “meta-information” (information about other information).

Description-en: commandline package manager
 This package provides commandline tools for searching and
 managing as well as querying information about packages
 as a low-level access to all features of the libapt-pkg library.
 .
 These include:
  * apt-get for retrieval of packages and information about them
    from authenticated sources and for installation, upgrade and
    removal of packages together with their dependencies
  * apt-cache for querying available information about installed
    as well as installable packages
  * apt-cdrom to use removable media as a source for packages
  * apt-config as an interface to the configuration settings
  * apt-key as an interface to manage authentication keys

					In a list of conditions to be met, the comma serves as a separator. It must be interpreted as a logical “and”. In conditions, the vertical bar (“|”) expresses a logical “or” (it is an inclusive “or”, not an exclusive “either/or”). Carrying greater priority than “and”, it can be used as many times as necessary. Thus, the dependency “(A or B) and C” is written <code
                class="command">A | B, C</code>. In contrast, the expression “A or (B and C)” should be written as “(A or B) and (A or C)”, since the <code

					The dependencies system is a good mechanism for guaranteeing the operation of a program, but it has another use with “meta-packages”. These are empty packages that only describe dependencies.

					This field introduces the very interesting concept of a “virtual package”. It has many roles, but two are of particular importance. The first role consists in using a virtual package to associate a generic service with it (the package “provides” the service). The second indicates that a package completely replaces another, and that for this purpose it can also satisfy the dependencies that the other would satisfy. It is thus possible to create a substitution package without having to use the same package name.

The user can go about their business while the system handles the installation on its own, without having to stay there staring at the screen waiting for questions.

				In effect, in this situation, <code

If, however, the file has changed, it will try to update this file. Two cases are possible: either the administrator has not touched this configuration file, in which case <code
              class="command">dpkg</code> automatically installs the new version; or the file has been modified, in which case <code
              class="command">dpkg</code> asks the administrator which version they wish to use (the old one with modifications, or the new one provided with the package). To assist in making this decision, <code
              class="command">dpkg</code> offers to display a “<code
              class="command">diff</code>” that shows the difference between the two versions. If the user chooses to retain the old version, the new one will be stored in the same location in a file with the <code
              class="filename">.dpkg-dist</code> suffix. If the user chooses the new version, the old one is retained in a file with the <code
              class="filename">.dpkg-old</code> suffix. Another available action consists of momentarily interrupting <code
              class="command">dpkg</code> to edit the file and attempt to re-instate the relevant modifications (previously identified with <code
              class="command">diff</code>).

				<code

This makes it less than enjoyable for those who wish to run updates in a non-interactive manner. This is why this program offers options that allow the system to respond automatically according to the same logic: <code
                class="command">--force-confold</code> retains the old version of the file; <code
                class="command">--force-confnew</code> will use the new version of the file (these choices are respected, even if the file has not been changed by the administrator, which only rarely has the desired effect). Adding the <code
                class="command">--force-confdef</code> option tells <code
                class="command">dpkg</code> to decide by itself when possible (in other words, when the original configuration file has not been touched), and only uses <code
                class="command">--force-confnew</code> or <code
                class="command">--force-confold</code> for other cases.
